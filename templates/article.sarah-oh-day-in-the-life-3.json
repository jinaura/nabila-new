Normally I do a floor workout or run on the treadmill. <\/p><p><strong>7:17  a.m.:<\/strong> I come home to shower and do my beauty routine. What I do really depends on the day, my energy level and skincare needs. But I love layering products like toners and essences and then slathering on a thick moisturizer at the end because I have really dry and eczema-prone skin. I also wear a lot of sunscreen because I’m always filming. <\/p><p><strong>7:55 a.m.<\/strong>: Makeup is next. I love wearing the Rose Inc <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/products\/skin-enhance-luminous-tinted-serum\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/products\/skin-enhance-luminous-tinted-serum\"><strong>Tinted Serum in Shade 060<\/strong><\/a> because it’s so lightweight and evens everything out.

I love it because it’s so creamy and hydrating, then I use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/products\/cream-blush\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/products\/cream-blush\"><strong>Cream Blush<\/strong><\/a> on my cheeks. I’ll always be a forever fan. My favorite shades are Foxglove, Azalea, and Daylily. Foxglove was my first Rose Inc purchase that got me hooked on the brand. It’s stunning and I love wearing this in the summer. Because I fell so hard for Foxglove I ended up purchasing Azalea, too, it’s the perfect berry shade for the ‘Cold Girl Blush’ look that was trending last winter. I love it on the lips for a monochromatic look. <\/p><p>For lips, I usually use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/products\/satin-lip-color-rich-refillable-lipstick\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/products\/satin-lip-color-rich-refillable-lipstick\"><strong>Satin Lip in Besotted<\/strong><\/a> —  it’s such a pretty, neutral beige. <\/p>"}}},"block_order":["b3e1d500-0a44-4488-b638-2ce4d7d2f931"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/SARAH_OH_6_JPG.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row"}},"1644479609a457d713":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"","text_center":"<p><strong>8:12 a.m.<\/strong>: I make an Americano or latte with my Breville.
