For framework, we turn to Dr. Baumann, who has written textbooks on the subject. “For me, it means these ingredients have a biologic activity or scientific method of action that has been proven,” she says. That means anything from green tea (the polyphenols of which has been<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3390139\/\" target=\"_blank\"> shown<\/a> to be rich in skin-protecting antioxidants) to retinoids (<a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/17200942\/\" target=\"_blank\">proven<\/a> to inhibit collagen degradation and to promote collagen production) can be thought of as \"active\". As for the latter question, “there is no specific limit on the number of actives one’s skin can handle,” says <a href=\"https:\/\/isclinical.com\/science\/clinical-director.html\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Charlene DeHaven<\/a>, FACEP, M.D., a pioneer in anti-aging medicine who serves as Clinical Director at iS Clinical by Innovative Skincare. “However, there is a limit on how much product activity one’s skin can handle before injury occurs and the skin objects with a reaction or complication.”<\/p><p>Those with more melanin-rich skin can be particularly susceptible to some complications, like hyperpigmentation. “It’s even more important in skin of color to ease your way into actives and to pair them properly, as irritation and inflammation translates into an overproduction of melanin (i.e. dark spots) in melanin-rich skin,” Dr. Obioha says. “The worst thing you can do is cause more dark spots while trying to treat dark spots which can occur as a result of too much irritation.”<\/p><p>Acne, dryness, flaking, congestion, and redness count as additional skin woes that can result from improperly layering ingredients, but it’s also worth noting that filler ingredients (like <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/14572300\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>fragrance<\/strong><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3858659\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>dyes<\/strong><\/a>, and <a href=\"https:\/\/pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/7085276\/#:~\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>propylene glycol<\/strong><\/a>) can cause allergic reactions or hives in some.

Though skin reactions vary considerably by skin type, Dr. Baumann provides this example: “Hyaluronic acid usually increases penetration of water soluble ingredients like green tea and vitamin C, which is good, but also increases penetration of skin lighteners, retinoids, and benzoyl peroxide, which can increase [their] side effects.”<\/p>"}},"relatedstories":{"type":"article-related-stories","disabled":true,"settings":{}},"1664388773f56f0e7a":{"type":"1col-image-video","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/7_c339b531-3685-4927-8663-a894cc914226.jpg","link":"","custom_video_url":"","author":""}},"1664388791180e0e92":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":true,"title":"WHEN IN DOUBT, CONSULT A PRO","text_center":"<p>While it may seem tempting to cocktail trendy single-active products—like pure L-ascorbic acid and niacinamide powders or 2% salicylic acid in witch hazel, for example—to limit filler ingredients and save money, an expertly curated routine might still be a better investment over time.<\/p><p>“A complex or lengthy regimen is not required for beautiful skin,” says Dr. DeHaven. “A few well-chosen products made with the best ingredients possible can be combined into a minimalistic regimen that gives healthy, beautiful skin.” And when in doubt? “It’s beneficial to seek advice from a known and trusted skin-care professional.”<br\/><br\/>Photographs by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/nikki.cruz\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Nikki Cruz<\/strong><\/a>.<\/p>"}}},"order":["main","16593834165011d04f","166438166566be8e9c","16643883671eb51d6f","1664381683e5bf4a0b","relatedstories","1664388773f56f0e7a","1664388791180e0e92"]}
