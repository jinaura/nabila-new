But I would say that I pay more attention to my skin as I’m getting older. I love tanning and being in the sun, but I’ve realized that’s not the best thing for my skin. And if I do choose to be in the sun a lot, I want to take the best care of my skin. So after-sun care is also very important to me at the moment. And since being pregnant, there are a lot of hormonal changes that my body has gone through, which reflects in your skin. So I would definitely say my beauty routines now really focus on the health of my skin rather than makeup. <\/p>"}},"eb490acb-2296-41b7-9351-a41e319924c2":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>What has your confidence journey been like?<\/p>"}},"3556d1f9-49bd-475c-a81e-24e00fb3b91f":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"CMAB:","description":"<p>I am half Dutch, half Lebanese and grew up in Holland.

I always felt like I had to explain my roots and tell people about the beauty of Lebanon and the wider region. Even though there is a lot of conflict in the Middle East I think it is one of the most beautiful parts of the world because of its rich heritage, its people… I imagined myself becoming a journalist who would share stories from there so I applied to SOAS in London to do a BA in Middle Eastern Studies. <\/p>"}},"95e20ae1-b2c0-4c64-bffc-0927339922bd":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>What inspired you to pivot careers?<\/p>"}},"fa9a97da-61bb-469d-beba-4d96e27da688":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"CMAB:","description":"<p>As I was studying, the Arab Spring broke out and Lebanon was booming. A lot of young people were opening hotels, bars and guesthouses... There were a lot of articles naming Beirut as a hotspot destination. It was a very exciting time to be studying the Middle East – it was hopeful. But then the uprisings turned very sour. When I graduated I felt deeply saddened by where the region was at. I’m a very sensitive person and didn’t feel like I could handle a career that would be focused on writing article after article on devastation and applied to various different jobs in film and in fashion instead.  Long story short, I always dreamt of creating a space with Joris where we could give a feeling of warmth and inspiration to people. When his grandmother passed we moved to Amsterdam to figure out what to do with her space. And somehow now the story has come full circle because I am able to bring stories (whether it be through fashion or books in the library) from the place I love the most, Lebanon, into this space and share it. <\/p>"}}},"block_order":["a4454be2-c650-4593-b4a0-9f3fc23ec4c3","7465299c-0607-4ae7-ba2a-ae85d73c3d12","eb490acb-2296-41b7-9351-a41e319924c2","3556d1f9-49bd-475c-a81e-24e00fb3b91f","95e20ae1-b2c0-4c64-bffc-0927339922bd","fa9a97da-61bb-469d-beba-4d96e27da688"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/ITOApJcc.jpg","link":"","author":"Verity Pemberton","placement":"row-reverse"}},"1659374669bd3cf3e0":{"type":"2col-simage-limage","settings":{"placement":"row-reverse","image1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/do0d09c.jpg","link_1":"","author1":"Verity Pemberton","image2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Xs8YAFu0.jpg","link_2":"","video_url":"","custom_video_url":"","author2":""}},"1659374491403e8092":{"type":"1col-text-dropcap","blocks":{"aae28eb3-2365-41b5-9985-114312c0dbe3":{"type":"text","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>How has your approach to beauty evolved since having a baby?<\/p>"}},"e83ce333-859f-40bd-9e37-6f2ae0a3106d":{"type":"text","settings":{"dropcap":"CMAB:","description":"<p>The ingredients in any beauty product are very important to me, especially now that I have a baby, because whatever I wear gets onto her skin because we hug and we cuddle and things like that.
