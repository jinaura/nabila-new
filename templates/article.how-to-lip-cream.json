While there’s no correct order in which to apply your makeup, Rick recommends starting with the eyes, followed by complexion and leaving the lips for last. “There are a few reasons why starting with your eyes is the best application technique,” she explains. “Skin prep is the most important step, so if you start with the eyes, it gives time for your skincare products to penetrate and settle into the skin before moving on to the complexion. Another great reason is it makes the clean-up process of any shadow or glitter fall-out easier, and prevents your foundation or concealer from being ruined.” The same goes for the lips. Before you apply your lipstick, make sure they are exfoliated and hydrated with a lip scrub and balm. <\/p><p><\/p>","placement_mobile":"mobile-column-reverse"}},"1635376222a775bae4":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":false,"quotes":"“If you start with the eyes, it gives time for your skincare products to penetrate and settle into the skin.”","author_quotes":""}},"164281056314a4f446":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"338f7c27-4732-4a97-bd5c-59edebc3faf2":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"NATURALLY RADIANT WITH EVER LOVED","desc":"<p>“This look is all about radiance,” says White. “The emphasis is on natural beauty while subtly enhancing the features and imparting a perfectly sun-kissed complexion.
