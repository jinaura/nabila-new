Unopened products have never been exposed to air, and likely aren’t contaminated. However, she says it's still important to keep an unopened product’s expiration date in mind. The active ingredients may be less potent,  and can degrade and irritate the skin over time. And even if the product is still effective and harmless, Dr. King says the longer it goes unused, it may be less enjoyable to use because it can become clumpy or dried out.<br\/><br\/><\/p>"}}},"block_order":["59b8d16d-b7b1-4a52-aba5-b0a677508a42","362cb8db-a068-4137-9298-4149a04c355b","51fae7f9-1b4a-41fa-8504-9524c341d428"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body-1_acc21fd8-a2d7-4511-b7a3-817bcb75552b.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row-reverse"}},"1654195865027c79c5":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":false,"quotes":"”If you notice the color has slightly changed or even the texture of the product, it’s time to toss it...”","author_quotes":""}},"164910654341c6774f":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"47046ca8-e320-47e7-a76c-bc349079eafe":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Lip products: 1 to 1.5 years","desc":"<p>According to Akram, most lip product brands offer a one-and-a-half-year lifespan for lipsticks, and one year for lip glosses.
