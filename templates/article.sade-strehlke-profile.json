The kicker? No matter the agenda item, you can expect Carlos to do it in a stunning sartorial look. While living and working stylishly is definitely a calling card for this former <em>Vogue<\/em> editor, making time for self-care has also become non-negotiable for showing up as her best self every day. “For me, self-care is a way of saying to myself, ‘You deserve more and that’s okay,’” she tells Rose Inc. “It’s my way of telling myself that I don’t always have to be on and producing something—that I deserve [rest].”<\/p><p>All in all, Carlos feels her best when she’s following her own path, no matter what. “It’s a very visceral experience,” she shares. And true to that path comes with setting healthy boundaries. “I now see boundaries as a super important form of self-care,” she explains. “For so long, as a Black woman occupying white spaces, I felt I had to be a certain way. Now, if I feel like I’m being taken advantage of or not getting all that I’ve worked for, I speak up about it.” Here, Carlos expands further on how her idea of self-care takes many different forms, from lighting candles to simply taking the time to listen to her favorite podcasts. She details her own beauty journey influenced by her Texas upbringing and stacked with lessons on embracing her hair (while looking to icons like<strong> <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/traceeellisross\/?hl=en\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/traceeellisross\/?hl=en\/\"><strong>Tracee Ellis Ross<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong>for inspiration) and using her platform to uplift people of color in fashion and beauty.<\/p>"}},"16391019784c81622d":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"2ff41739-ef20-4792-adb0-abefb97bb950":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>Where does your confidence stem from?<\/p>"}},"08e73282-b1b5-4ca6-b740-032624cc6d03":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"SS:","description":"<p>My great aunt. She played a huge role in raising me. Also, obviously my mother, grandmother and great grandmother have all really shaped my confidence. My parents were divorced but my mom built a beautiful life for herself and me. I had such a great support system between all of these women. They used to tell me that I was the best thing since sliced bread. I’ve definitely had moments where I felt less confident in certain areas of my life, but my sense of self was always super strong and never wavered. The biggest lesson I’ve learned is that I should never tolerate people putting me down. I remember in first or second grade, some kids made fun of me. My great aunt told me to go back and tell them, ‘I won’t tolerate that.’ Of course, they just ended up making more fun of me. But I’ve really kept that message with me throughout my years. During my twenties, I think I cared a lot about being a certain size. But my confidence has grown immensely since then. I no longer care about weight or size. It’s all about whether or not I feel good these days. Do I feel good in my skin? Am I a good person? Do I feel like I’m a good partner and friend? Those are the things that give me the most confidence.<\/p>"}},"9c87c2d3-d5ff-4364-99a8-04f03b34a50e":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>Who were your biggest beauty inspirations growing up?<\/p>"}},"a9e30dd6-8c18-4d63-be67-079af378d66d":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"SS:","description":"<p>Definitely my mother.

So I got into tennis and SoulCycle. I try to work out anywhere from three to five times a week, sometimes more. But just to have an hour for myself every day where I work out with friends or my husband has been a great way to stabilize me and my hormones postpartum. I've never had postpartum depression, but I do get baby blues, which basically just means you feel a little down, especially while your hormones are readjusting. It can take anywhere from six months to two years to feel like yourself again after having a baby. And my second and third child are exactly two years apart. So I feel like I didn't really have a full recovery from Scarlett before I had gotten pregnant again with Sloan.
