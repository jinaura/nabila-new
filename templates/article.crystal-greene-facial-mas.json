There isn’t necessarily a method to increase circulation in the skin; you just want to stimulate it. Use your knuckles to massage your jaw. Use the palms of your hands to massage the forehead. Use your thumb and index finger to pinch the cheeks quickly. Be intuitive and creative. Start with clean skin, and apply a few drops of oil to you as a medium to glide your hands and fingers.<\/p>"}},"f9b1735a-99c2-40cd-a350-6f82086b91b7":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"How long should I massage my face for?","desc":"<p>If your time allows for five minutes, do five minutes.

I’ve seen it really work on a handful of clients. Also just brushing the brows with a spoolie is important because when you get rid of dry skin, there’s a better chance for growth. I also love castor oil, but it’s not necessarily for growth, which a lot of people don’t realize. I think it’s just a great conditioner for the brows, though. You can leave it on for a few minutes and then rinse it off. I think you can’t go wrong with a hair-growth supplement either. <\/p>"}},"f2363f93-fbaa-487b-8011-f5746d1079c6":{"type":"1col-text-center","disabled":true,"settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"Selecting Your Brow Makeup","text_center":"<p>I tell all of my clients to buy [brow products] one shade lighter than what you think it should be, especially if you want a natural look.
