Hoffman seconds this advice and adds: “Blue eyes always look amazing in coppers and corals, but any brown will generally flatter a blue eye. To bring out more green in the eye, play with shades of plum and purple.”<\/p><p>The only color Ma recommends avoiding is blue because it’ll be too much of the same tone.

If you’re in the mood for a look that’s just outside the box, she suggests brown mascaras for those with blue and green eyes. “It makes the eyes pop and gives definition to the lash line without looking too made up,” she says. “For brown eyes, I like using eggplant and maroon-colored mascaras. It adds sensuality to the look and makes the entire makeup look so special.”<\/p><p>You can also have some fun with different colored eyeliners. “Gray eyeliner works beautifully with blue eyes,” Ma says. “Green eyes complement bronze or wine-colored liners. Brown eyes work nicely with navy or eggplant liners.” And like mascara, black eyeliners are universally flattering. <\/p><p>Going back to the color wheel theory, Hoffman says the same rules apply for shades of liner and mascara; here,  he thinks of them as ways to add depth to the look rather than shade. “For instance, to make the eye color look lighter, add more liner [in] any dark shade and several coats of mascara,” he says. “To make the eye color look richer or deeper, try a lighter shimmer shadow with a damp brush as a liner and use one coat of mascara.”<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["ace9cd93-2e10-47a0-94dd-8ce2f11887ed"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body-mascara-section_2ccb0a82-b73e-464a-8a3e-fb285b93f6e2.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row"}},"166489641550e44145":{"type":"shop-collection","settings":{"title":"SHOP THE STORY","description":"","link_text":"Shop all","home_featured_products":"","product_link_label":"Buy Now","hide-variant":true,"dots":true,"arrows":true}},"7a7cc635-c780-48a4-a40d-d88e45d3cf4b":{"type":"text-image-carousel-module","blocks":{"template--15851137237180__7a7cc635-c780-48a4-a40d-d88e45d3cf4b-166508024748534fb3-1":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"satin-shimmer-duet-eyeshadow"}},"9e7f9b31-02b9-4cd5-af3e-3badf5181edf":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"satin-eyeshadow-refill"}},"14528e21-a9df-4d16-88db-08100f6f62ca":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"lash-lift-mascara"}}},"block_order":["template--15851137237180__7a7cc635-c780-48a4-a40d-d88e45d3cf4b-166508024748534fb3-1","9e7f9b31-02b9-4cd5-af3e-3badf5181edf","14528e21-a9df-4d16-88db-08100f6f62ca"],"settings":{"carousel_type":"grid_carousel","title":"Heading","desc":"<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
