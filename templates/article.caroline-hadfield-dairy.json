Pipette Baby and JVN Hair launched in the coming years, then Costa Brazil came aboard, but launching clean color with Rose Inc in 2021 was different. <br\/><br\/>“It’s been fun working with Rosie [Huntington-Whiteley], building on her content platform and having her experience of being in the hair and makeup chair,” says Caroline. “This category has been a lot more difficult than others, getting ingredients that perform at that quality level within the high benchmark we set, but still ensuring high-quality color payoffs and pigments.” But it’s also made success even sweeter: On the one-year anniversary of the Rose Inc line, the brand is thriving across the globe.
