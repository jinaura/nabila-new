In it, she discusses the beauty of embracing her gray hair. “There’s a particular message out there around aging: Gray hair is feared, wrinkles become the enemy,” she told me. “I’m a much happier person now that I’m not running from myself and who I am during this stage of my life. I’m having fun trying new styles in this period of acceptance.” I hope that this narrative continues to change so that we can all see the beauty and excitement in aging, graying and loving the skin we’re in at any phase of our lives.<\/p><p><\/p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/blogs\/profile\/mara-brock-akil-interview\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/blogs\/profile\/mara-brock-akil-interview\"><strong>Read Mara's Profile<\/strong><\/a><\/p>"}},"4eca897b-d70a-4da5-a2e7-0dc9f5a7d236":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>What are some of the overarching beauty standards in Mexican American culture, and did you hold yourself to any of them?<\/p>"}},"332c2060-a928-46c6-8771-41b74810ba40":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"AL:","description":"<p>We watched Mexican soap operas when I was younger with my mom.

Each one of them goes above and beyond in their respective careers, often defying the odds that are, at times, stacked against them. I think the most challenging — yet most rewarding — part about doing this work is ensuring that I tell someone’s story in the way that they’d want to be seen. That means meeting people with compassion and empathy in order to stand in their shoes. In general, I’m always thinking about how there’s no such thing as one type or standard of beauty. As a writer, I know it’s partially my responsibility to help depict that as well. That said, I’m always wishing I had more bandwidth to tell as many stories as possible. But I try to use this energy as motivation to keep going, and have patience and faith that I can continue to push the envelope little by little.<\/p><p><\/p><p>While the Rose Inc content site has been around since 2018, we only launched our first product one year ago — the same time I came aboard as an editor.
