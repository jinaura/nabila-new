She told me I was too young for it all.  <br\/><br\/>When I got to college, I saw people wearing makeup and it made me want to try it too. I started experimenting. I remember I bought a lot of different lipsticks from Sephora. I went through a phase where I was just obsessed with lipsticks. I would buy and try so many different things until I found what worked for me. I used to do a lot and try really hard to find the perfect makeup routine. I’m definitely more minimal now. But I’m glad I had that phase to figure things out, especially since I started relatively late with exploring makeup.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["2ff41739-ef20-4792-adb0-abefb97bb950","08e73282-b1b5-4ca6-b740-032624cc6d03","9c87c2d3-d5ff-4364-99a8-04f03b34a50e","a9e30dd6-8c18-4d63-be67-079af378d66d","cabd3b33-301b-4f09-8618-d501b26918d4","eb1ff1f4-8713-40ba-ac24-4db2c8d08386"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/caroline-lin9.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row-reverse"}},"1652494758f9b67909":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":false,"quotes":"“Beauty is about being comfortable with who I am and my own body.”","author_quotes":""}},"163537294920e1cd97":{"type":"1col-text-dropcap","blocks":{"f83227d2-94bc-4bfd-b486-65f3acb32111":{"type":"text","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>Speaking of makeup routines, what are your go-to products currently?<\/p>"}},"ea5710ea-cea4-4362-b014-9d6a5eaa143a":{"type":"text","settings":{"dropcap":"CL:","description":"<p>I've been using the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/collections\/complexion\/products\/softlight-concealer\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>Rose Inc concealer<\/strong><\/span><\/a>.
