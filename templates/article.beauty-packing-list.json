Still, the importance of sunscreen is so vital for protecting the skin from the sun’s harmful UV rays and preventing premature aging, it’s worth repeating.<br\/><br\/>There are two main types of sunscreens available: physical and chemical. “Physical sunscreens contain ingredients such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which are great for acne-prone skin because these ingredients are non-comedogenic,” Dr. Green says. “Chemical sunscreens contain ingredients like oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate or octinoxate that act as a sponge to absorb the sun’s UV rays.”<br\/><\/p><p>For the best protection, Dr. Green recommends packing both types of sunscreen and applying the chemical one first and the physical sunscreen over top. Plus, she reminds us to reapply every 90 minutes and after getting out of the water. Just be sure to pat dry first, so the sunscreen doesn’t run off your skin.<br\/><br\/><\/p>"}},"c9c985d2-12f1-4180-a113-e0d8c5fd3d46":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Sun-protecting lip balm","desc":"<p>Packing a lip balm with SPF is a must.
