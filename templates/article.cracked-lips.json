When the weather is cold, she explains, dry and cracked lips become exacerbated because the humidity in the air decreases, causing more moisture to evaporate from the skin into the air. Furthermore, wind exposure can worsen the issue. Dr. Cheung adds that contact with irritating chemicals such as salicylic acid, camphor, menthol, and fragrances can also cause lip cracking.<br\/><br\/>In addition to external factors such as weather and irritating ingredients, Dr. Cheung says our internal health can also impact our lip health. In particular, she notes that inflammatory disease, yeast overgrowth, and deficiencies in zinc, iron, vitamin B and thyroid hormones can cause cracked lips. Cracked lips may also point to a more serious issue. \"Sun-damaged skin can harbor precancerous lesions on the lips that mimic cracked skin,\" Dr. Cheung says. <\/p>"}},"16391019784c81622d":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"b3e1d500-0a44-4488-b638-2ce4d7d2f931":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"How To Deal with Cracked Lips","desc":"<p><br\/><\/p>"}},"a87299e5-c4b7-499b-b187-915a3169aed9":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"1.

Dr. King encourages reapplying lip balm frequently and coating the lips with a thick layer. However, not all lip balms are the same, so it's important to read the ingredient list.<\/p><p>Some lip balms contain humectant ingredients (think hyaluronic acid or glycerin), which attract moisture. However, as Dr. King puts it, “Humectant ingredients need to be combined with emollients and occlusives to be effective.” Each type of ingredient plays a key role. Dr. King explains that emollients such as ceramides protect the skin barrier, and occlusive ingredients like petrolatum, bee’s wax and coconut oil lock the moisture in and prevent it from evaporating. In other words, lip balms without occlusives will allow the moisture to evaporate from the lips and leave them feeling drier. <\/p>"}},"1643079214b558b4d0":{"type":"1col-image-video","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/unnamed_1585x_389a50fd-1810-43eb-a42f-b01bc382cad0.jpg","video_url":"","custom_video_url":"","author":"<a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/hannahillierphotography\/\">Hannah Hillier<\/a>"}},"1643079222f5e34bf5":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":false,"quotes":"“Humectant ingredients need to be combined with emollients and occlusives to be effective.”","author_quotes":""}},"1639359785f918ec7e":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"4.
