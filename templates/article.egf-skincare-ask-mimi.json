Growth factors have slowly entered the skincare market and are known to help build collagen. With their introduction, there has been a fair amount of confusion and controversy with their use. The controversy comes from their source as they can either be bioengineered, or come from human stem cells (skin, fat, bone or even fetus). Only the proteins given off from the source are used, but it still incites mixed feelings in many.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["a87299e5-c4b7-499b-b187-915a3169aed9","547b781b-56cd-425d-beb7-adc1bf3ca8e7"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/23_AlwaysOn_April_Lip-Treatment_Swatch_Lulu_McArdle_113_V2_AP_CROP_a6327023-dc09-4939-8eef-a6c91f7b9450.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row-reverse"}},"1643079222f5e34bf5":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":true,"quotes":"“What people end up experiencing is not only more moisture, but also restored, pillowy-soft lips.”","author_quotes":""}},"1643079274a50bcc43":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"What is EGF skincare?","text_center":"<p>We like to ensure [an ingredient] is multi-benefit and provides immediate benefits you can see in addition to the long-term benefits achieved through our use of powerful, active ingredients.  Specifically to the application of the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/products\/lip-treatment-hydrating-lip-balm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/products\/lip-treatment-hydrating-lip-balm\"> <strong>Lip Treatment<\/strong><\/a>, users will notice an immediate feeling of hydration (coming from our squalane), along with a plush and glossy finish.

It took a few iterations to get it right and have the formula hold the plant-EGF ingredient in the balm system without kicking it out. In the end, we were able to create a formula that has a nice cushion that feels good on the lips, and adds that extra layer of hydration and moisture-barrier support they need.  <\/p>"}}},"block_order":["323722db-3555-4246-adee-74bfe0ab8a8c","3f0a3bbe-402a-4f1d-af41-639266f3567b"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/23_AlwaysOn_April_Lip-Treatment-Night_Lulu_McArdle_001_V2_AP_Crop.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row"}},"1647835110094f6413":{"type":"1col-text-center","disabled":true,"settings":{"full_width":true,"title":"SHOP THE BODY COLLECTION NOW","text_center":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/pages\/satin-lip-color-lipstick\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/pages\/satin-lip-color-lipstick\"><strong>Explore Now.<\/strong><\/a><\/p>"}},"de96dde4-a931-4d62-8984-9788cd300278":{"type":"product-set-carousel","settings":{"title":"SHOP LIP PRODUCTS","desc":"","collection":"lip","dots":true,"arrows":true}},"relatedstories":{"type":"article-related-stories","settings":{}}},"order":["main","16391019784c81622d","1643079222f5e34bf5","1643079274a50bcc43","16458331836d6311a5","1647835110094f6413","de96dde4-a931-4d62-8984-9788cd300278","relatedstories"]}
