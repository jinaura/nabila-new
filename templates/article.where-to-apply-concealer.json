The same concealer shade principle that applies for dark spots goes here, too: match it to your skin tone and foundation, so it blends rather than brightens the area. The best way to conceal blemishes depends on the stage of the blemish. \"If the skin is intact — fingers crossed you didn't squeeze or pop — the skin should remain dry. 'It’s just a matter of putting on a dot of concealer, leaving it to set and then blending it out,\" she says. \"If it's oilier, you might want to use a mattifying primer first, or go in with a matte finish concealer, so that it doesn't slide off.\" Dealing with a particularly hellish breakout?
