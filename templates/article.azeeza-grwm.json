But I remember when I graduated, I was working with a magazine. I went to interview a renowned photographer friend of mine. And I remember him saying to me, ‘Chelsea, you need to put on makeup. You can't be walking around like this. You're beautiful, but you need to put on makeup.’ I remember going through my mom's makeup bag trying to figure out my foundation shade. But again, my mom's lighter than me. Once I moved to the States, I started going to the MAC beauty counter because they were the only ones that carried darker shades at the time.

I brought all of the accessories and the shoes to go with each. So we traveled deep! But overall, I wanted to keep it subtle (if that word even exists in my fashion vocabulary!) to let my date and muse Elaine Welteroth shine in her ensemble. Therefore I chose something that embodies our brand DNA with one of our oversized organza mini dresses. I have been working creatively with Jimmy Choo and as a part of that I am a total Choo girl. So, a statement Azeeza LBD with Jimmy Choo platform over-the-knee sock boots gave it more allure and made it more fun. With Elaine, I chose to keep her in a signature volume gown in one of our identifiable pop colors. We felt fabulous — that's all that mattered. <\/p>"}},"f49c04f7-7b40-44f3-8b68-96032b00fe0a":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>What were you going for in terms of the beauty look?<\/p>"}},"9e22b2c8-ec70-447d-bcce-0faa49f5f401":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"AK:","description":"<p>To me, makeup is really about enhancing the face.
