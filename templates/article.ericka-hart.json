When I became a young teen, there was this assumption that I should be more feminine. When I was little though, I would dress however I wanted. I had freedom and no one would make a big deal out of it. When I moved to Puerto Rico after my mom’s passing [from breast cancer], there were a lot of societal pressures in terms of how I was ‘supposed’ to present. My dad would always remind me of how other young girls were dressing, with dresses and lipstick and heels. But I honestly didn’t feel the urge to wear heels until I was about 18. In Maryland I felt freedom, which felt tied to my mother. In Puerto Rico, I felt a bit constrained as a teenager. I was also just a young person grieving and trying to figure that out as well.<\/p>"}},"9c87c2d3-d5ff-4364-99a8-04f03b34a50e":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>What’s something that you once considered a flaw that you now appreciate and love about yourself?<\/p>"}},"a9e30dd6-8c18-4d63-be67-079af378d66d":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"EH:","description":"<p>The first thing that comes to mind is hair. Hair can be such a journey for Black people. The main messaging I received growing up in society and school was that my hair was bad. But that was wrong. When I was younger I would get braids all the time, but they weren’t popular at all. It just felt like something you had to do in the summer so you didn't end up frustrating your parents. But I remember being so excited to have braids because my hair would move more like a white person’s. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve had to sit with myself and address where those ideas, and all that pain, came from. <\/p>"}}},"block_order":["2ff41739-ef20-4792-adb0-abefb97bb950","08e73282-b1b5-4ca6-b740-032624cc6d03","9c87c2d3-d5ff-4364-99a8-04f03b34a50e","a9e30dd6-8c18-4d63-be67-079af378d66d"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body-1_70524ec8-56f1-46ab-accd-62ad6c85e7f5.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row"}},"163537294920e1cd97":{"type":"1col-text-dropcap","blocks":{"f83227d2-94bc-4bfd-b486-65f3acb32111":{"type":"text","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>Who would you say had the biggest beauty influence on you growing up?<\/p>"}},"ea5710ea-cea4-4362-b014-9d6a5eaa143a":{"type":"text","settings":{"dropcap":"EH:","description":"<p>I would definitely say my grandmother and my great grandma.
