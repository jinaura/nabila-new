To marry the colors, she picked up a mixture of the two hues on a small brush and used it to slightly extend the shape into a slight wing, then added a little color under the model’s bottom lash-line for balance.<\/p>"}},"1664896381f2f2a5f7":{"type":"1col-image-video","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Daytime_Smoky_Eye_3.webp","link":"","video_url":"","custom_video_url":"","author":""}},"166490058928056974":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":true,"quotes":"‘‘ WHAT I LOVE ABOUT EACH ONE OF THESE LOOKS IS THAT THEY’RE FAST.  ’’","author_quotes":""}},"d0bfde02-696b-456e-ad3b-a117737bc805":{"type":"2col-simage-limage","settings":{"placement":"row","image1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Daytime_Smoky_Eye_5.webp","link_1":"","author1":"","image2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Daytime_Smoky_Eye_4.webp","link_2":"","video_url":"","custom_video_url":"","author2":""}},"b81a4b14-d9ab-4c9e-8630-2cf61c430bcc":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":true,"title":"","text_center":"<p>Building a smoky eye can be intimidating, but Westman assures us that her cream\/powder hybrid formula is both buildable and easy to use.
