So, what’s her resolution for 2023? “Well, technically, I’ve already started my 2023 resolution: For the past month, I’ve been pushing myself to do everything I never want to do. Yes, they may be inconvenient or uncomfortable, but they’re necessary — everything from waking up early to being more honest in my writing, showing up for my Pilates class and sending a scary text.
