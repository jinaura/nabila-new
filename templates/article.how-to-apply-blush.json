If you want to maintain the fresh, creamy texture, Milan recommends setting the blush with a spritz of your favorite makeup setting spray. Otherwise, she says, you can increase the blush’s longevity and lock it into place by dusting a light layer of translucent powder over it. One more option: If you also want it to be more pigmented, she recommends setting your cream or liquid blush with a light dusting of powder blush.<br\/><br\/>When layering different blushes, Espinoza also encourages having fun and creating your perfect blush shade and finish. For example, you may have a cream blush without any sheen to it, but you can layer it with a powder blush that has some sparkle to it to dress it up.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["3fa02f0f-3dae-4397-98c3-705fb97c160b"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/PDP-Model-Community-CONCEALER-LX140-BLUSH-ANEMONE-LIP-SCULPT-STILL-BROW-GEL-FILL05_4.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row"}},"relatedstories":{"type":"article-related-stories","settings":{}}},"order":["main","16428104941dd63fed","1635376222a775bae4","164281067875504fae","16469580094505a033","1646958311cf239d9d","16469585103bd81c47","relatedstories"]}
