Sebum is an oil that our sebaceous glands manufacture, which gives the skin its oily appearance and can cause bacterial overgrowth that leads to acne breakouts.<\/p><p>So, is having oily skin a bad thing? According to Dr. Ciraldo, not necessarily. “Many people with oily skin do have more acne, but this is not universally true,” she says. “The most common complaint about oily skin is that it looks very shiny, and for women, makeup doesn't go on well and evenly.”<\/p>"}},"1661202465ffcaf8ba":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":false,"quotes":"Causes Of Oily Skin","author_quotes":""}},"16391019784c81622d":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"b3e1d500-0a44-4488-b638-2ce4d7d2f931":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Heredity","desc":"<p>Unfortunately, oily skin is sometimes hereditary. “Some people inherit bigger, more active oil glands,” Dr. Ciraldo says.
