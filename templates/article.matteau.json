For her, it was always a place she and her husband would escape to once a year for the renowned art fair and cultural event, Art Basel. Long before launching her coveted hair line, Cohen majored in postmodern contemporary art at NYU and began going to Art Basel eight years ago as a way to honor her passion—and escape the brutal New York winter. “It’s an amazing way to enjoy a ton of art at once,” Cohen says. “It is a beautiful gathering of fairs, galleries, artists and creators. It’s a bunch of brilliant minds in one place.”<br\/><br\/>Still, it was actually the COVID-19 pandemic that finally opened her eyes to the possibility of making this lifestyle a year-round reality. Raised in South Florida, it was easy for Cohen to make the move to Miami last year to be closer to her extended family. Being surrounded by amazing food, relaxing spas, and amazing shopping didn’t hurt either. “The Latinx culture is really beautiful here,” she says. “It’s a very multicultural city and it comes across in <em>everything<\/em>. Many people think of it as only a party city, which it <em>is <\/em>great for that, but it’s also great for a spa getaway or simply just resting and relaxing.” <br\/><br\/>We at Rose Inc agree, which is why we'll be at the Lincoln Road Sephora on Saturday December 4 to celebrate the new Rose Inc with a pop-up flower stand. As for the rest of our weekend in Miami? We enlisted Cohen to help with that. Whether a replenishing spa massage to begin your day, lunch in an elegant courtyard, or cocktails at the most beautiful bar in South Beach, Cohen shares eight places not to miss during any Miami visit, below. <\/p>"}},"163831781725567025":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"a5adf81f-658c-4d0b-a9b4-dd3a305fe471":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Willabelle Ong","desc":"<p>When it comes to the most influential figures in her life, Willabelle Ong names her mother, who instilled in her the core value of leading with respect, which she says shaped her both personally and professionally. “Make the most out of every opportunity that comes your way with grace and humility.
