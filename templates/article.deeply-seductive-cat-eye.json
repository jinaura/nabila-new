First, to prepare and hydrate skin, Sir John cleansed with <a href=\"https:\/\/rstyle.me\/+1DhinfRd5TUROecImsaP5A\" target=\"_blank\">Bioderma Sensibio H2O<\/a> water.

A dab of <a href=\"https:\/\/rstyle.me\/+42c5W8dGD5VQALYYxSeV7Q\" target=\"_blank\">Stila Convertible Color<\/a> in Petunia perked up the cheeks, while <a href=\"https:\/\/rstyle.me\/+OLTAIZwkmWEPuFyRFQp8Kg\" target=\"_blank\">L’Oréal Paris Infallible Loose Setting Powder<\/a> kept excess shine at bay.<\/p><p>Next, the eyes.

Sir John applied <a href=\"https:\/\/rstyle.me\/+mR1Qo4dzsExkBEeOwYzugA\" target=\"_blank\">MAC matte lipstick in Kinda Sexy<\/a>, a light coral shade. He slightly overdrew the shape, but only at the centers of each lip. (“Overdrawing everywhere is a little too much like Pamela Anderson’s ‘90s look,” he quips.)
