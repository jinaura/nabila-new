In order to avoid inadvertently drying out your lips, Dr Bourelly suggests you start by reviewing your current product lineup and the specific ingredients within it that may be causing irritation and dryness.<\/p><p>“As is the case with most skincare recommendations, one wants to look for products that have a short list of ingredients,” says Dr Bourelly. “The more preservatives, coloring agents and ingredients designed to plump lips or prolong staying power of color, the greater chance the consumer will react poorly. All-day lipsticks [for example] can be drying, and if you find that you must use special products to remove the color at the end of the day, that might be creating problems, too. Less is more and fewer chemicals are always better.”<\/p><p>Once you’ve eliminated the causes of lip dryness, the solution to smoother lips is always rehydration. “Proper cell function relies on a well-hydrated cell,” Dr Bourelly explains. “Without that, the cell cannot serve as a reliable barrier. When the barrier is lost, the lips are more vulnerable to irritation and damage from outside agents.” While staying hydrated is one of the most important steps that you can take for  lip health to ensure moisture is boosted from within, using a lip treatment formulated with targeted ingredients is also crucial to properly moisturizing lips from the inside out. <\/p><p><br\/><\/p>"}}},"block_order":["5371fe2e-66dd-4fd1-b470-7afdede166e5"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/23_AlwaysOn_April_Lip-Treatment_Ice-Glass_Lulu_McArdle_021_V4_AP_crop.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row-reverse"}},"16438375133c6df828":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":true,"quotes":"“Lip skin, like all skin, serves as a barrier to outside elements.”","author_quotes":""}},"1659470318ac2e85cb":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"839a204d-c96e-432a-a9ef-e4f295b67b2c":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"WHAT ARE THE BEST INGREDIENTS FOR HYDRATED LIPS?","desc":"<p>Lip care starts with lip health, so while a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/products\/lip-treatment-hydrating-lip-balm\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/products\/lip-treatment-hydrating-lip-balm\"><strong>good lip moisturizing treatment<\/strong><\/a> should be packed with nourishing oils and protective ingredients to keep your lips soft and supple, actives that support skin health are also important. “Lip skin, like all skin, serves as a barrier to outside elements.

According to Dr. Bourelly, “Lip care for healthy, normal lips focuses on lubrication to offset dryness from normal wear and tear, and cosmetic products.” Reapplication, therefore, is the not-so-secret secret to keeping lips in their best shape. <\/p><p>In the morning, after cleansing, apply a generous amount of a hydrating lip treatment and reapply throughout the day as needed. Whatever you do, resist the temptation to lick your lips and avoid picking or biting, as this will only lead to further dryness and discomfort. If you feel the need to add some moisture back onto your lips, reach for your treatment instead.<\/p><p>For an added boost, exfoliate your lips once a week to keep them smooth and soft. Use a lip scrub to very gently buff away any dry or rough patches, then follow up with a hydrating lip treatment to keep your lips nourished and protected. Sloughing off dead and dry skin will not only promote skin cell turnover revealing fresher, smoother skin, but also allow your lips to absorb any treatment you’re applying more effectively. <\/p><p>At night, creating an occlusive layer on your lips is essential to help lock in moisture and promote healing. After cleansing, apply the Rose Inc. Lip Treatment Hydrating Balm as an overnight mask, allowing the targeted ingredients to work as you sleep.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["54c31f46-8df8-4052-8122-5ac757d45d41"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screenshot_2023-05-03_at_2.38.02_PM.png","link":"","author":"","placement":"row-reverse"}},"8e07daa5-6c95-4dbf-999a-2b1415c7b2de":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":false,"quotes":"\"Lip care for healthy, normal lips focuses on lubrication to offset dryness from normal wear and tear, and cosmetic products.\"","author_quotes":""}},"16594706917514817c":{"type":"product-set-carousel","settings":{"title":"SHOP THE STORY","desc":"","collection":"","dots":true,"arrows":true}},"1658782848b2ec4091":{"type":"product-collection-carousel-module","blocks":{"664f0cd2-7543-4022-8b8e-e19a84af80bf":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"lip-treatment-hydrating-lip-balm"}},"fed3703c-0eb0-4a5f-b0ac-76814db0a56e":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"satin-lip-set"}},"482bfd2d-d477-4ba7-be83-7318ba1d4981":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"solar-infusion-soft-focus-cream-bronzer"}},"a6598c6c-c948-4640-9d6e-9469805f7569":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"divine-color-blush-brush-set"}},"1f3b96e1-110b-4241-841a-2e20bb5f916b":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"solar-radiance-hydrating-cream-highlighter"}},"c777ed46-89ae-40fa-b257-a3a9e60e46f7":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"highlighter-brush"}},"af433b3d-1473-4cb0-ab1c-5ee9a5d7a6b6":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"bronzer-brush"}}},"block_order":["664f0cd2-7543-4022-8b8e-e19a84af80bf","fed3703c-0eb0-4a5f-b0ac-76814db0a56e","482bfd2d-d477-4ba7-be83-7318ba1d4981","a6598c6c-c948-4640-9d6e-9469805f7569","1f3b96e1-110b-4241-841a-2e20bb5f916b","c777ed46-89ae-40fa-b257-a3a9e60e46f7","af433b3d-1473-4cb0-ab1c-5ee9a5d7a6b6"],"settings":{"carousel_type":"grid_carousel","title":"","desc":"<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
