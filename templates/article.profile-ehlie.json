And true to that path comes with setting healthy boundaries. “I now see boundaries as a super important form of self-care,” she explains. “For so long, as a Black woman occupying white spaces, I felt I had to be a certain way. Now, if I feel like I’m being taken advantage of or not getting all that I’ve worked for, I speak up about it.” Here, Carlos expands further on how her idea of self-care takes many different forms, from lighting candles to simply taking the time to listen to her favorite podcasts.
