At any moment you could find her penning empowering cover stories for prestigious publications like<em> i-D <\/em>and <em>Elle<\/em>, keeping it real on her Instagram Live talk show <em>Your Favorite Auntie <\/em>or hosting a revolving door of on-camera and public speaking engagements. The kicker? No matter the agenda item, you can expect Carlos to do it in a stunning sartorial look. While living and working stylishly is definitely a calling card for this former <em>Vogue<\/em> editor, making time for self-care has also become non-negotiable for showing up as her best self every day. “For me, self-care is a way of saying to myself, ‘You deserve more and that’s okay,’” she tells Rose Inc. “It’s my way of telling myself that I don’t always have to be on and producing something—that I deserve [rest].”<\/p><p>All in all, Carlos feels her best when she’s following her own path, no matter what. “It’s a very visceral experience,” she shares. And true to that path comes with setting healthy boundaries. “I now see boundaries as a super important form of self-care,” she explains. “For so long, as a Black woman occupying white spaces, I felt I had to be a certain way. Now, if I feel like I’m being taken advantage of or not getting all that I’ve worked for, I speak up about it.” Here, Carlos expands further on how her idea of self-care takes many different forms, from lighting candles to simply taking the time to listen to her favorite podcasts. She details her own beauty journey influenced by her Texas upbringing and stacked with lessons on embracing her hair (while looking to icons like<strong> <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/traceeellisross\/?hl=en\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/traceeellisross\/?hl=en\/\"><strong>Tracee Ellis Ross<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong>for inspiration) and using her platform to uplift people of color in fashion and beauty.<\/p>"}},"163537292921f7d581":{"type":"2col-simage-limage","settings":{"placement":"row","image1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/retroflame_277906352_651563289248215_6083935336249481508_n.webp","link_1":"","author1":"","image2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/retroflame_277961455_277071491288269_3188848147159310441_n.webp","link_2":"","video_url":"","custom_video_url":"","author2":""}},"163537294920e1cd97":{"type":"1col-text-dropcap","blocks":{"f83227d2-94bc-4bfd-b486-65f3acb32111":{"type":"text","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>What would someone never guess about you?<\/p>"}},"ea5710ea-cea4-4362-b014-9d6a5eaa143a":{"type":"text","settings":{"dropcap":"EF:","description":"<p>I was very sporty growing up and played football for years.<\/p>"}},"16a2dbc1-0aed-4e09-b74b-1d1bda0a0577":{"type":"text","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>What are five things making you happy right now?<\/p>"}},"72eb0234-5805-4c75-8bd8-0548d5fdad14":{"type":"text","settings":{"dropcap":"EF:","description":"<p>Going to bed early.
