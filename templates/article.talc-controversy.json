Talc is the softest mineral known and incredibly absorbent, which is why it’s commonly used in setting powder, eyeshadow, liquid foundation, and anything that requires a silky-smooth texture or oil-absorbing powers. A quick survey of your makeup is likely to show the ingredient in one form or another, just look for words like talc, talcum, or magnesium silicate.<\/p><p>Since talc is mined from various sources, its purity also ranges, so many brands have replaced it with things like cornstarch, rice starch, mica, and silica to avoid any possibility of natural contamination. The biggest threat is from asbestos, a group of minerals often found near talc deposits that have been proven to cause many types of cancer. As you might assume, potential asbestos contamination is the wildcard in many of the arguments around talc safety, but it’s not the full story.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["9777af2d-0917-47b0-8274-32e01d2bcf9a"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body_1_3fc922f9-48c6-47fc-b7a0-cfb3b39e3667.webp","link":"","author":"","placement":"row"}},"1659383007ea0ce3e8":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":true,"title":"TALC: THE CASES","text_center":"<p>The vast majority of the cases in the news allege a connection between talc use and either ovarian cancer or mesothelioma, a very rare form of cancer that affects the tissue that surrounds many internal organs.<\/p><p>Johnson & Johnson currently <a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/story\/2020-01-06\/johnson-johnson-settles-baby-powder-cancer-case\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>faces around 17,000 suits<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong>that claim its baby powder caused cancers, the latest of which concluded with a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2020-02-27\/j-j-ordered-by-jury-to-pay-9-million-in-talc-cancer-case\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>$9 million dollar ruling for the plaintiff<\/strong><\/a> (J&J says it will appeal)—not an uncommon number amongst the<strong> <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.latimes.com\/business\/la-fi-baby-powder-cancer-20180712-story.html\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>billions of dollars it’s already paid out<\/strong><\/a><strong>. <\/strong>The crux of many of its cases is surrounding whether or not the company knew of potential asbestos contamination, but J&J stands by its claim that its products do not cause cancer and, in<strong> <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2019-12-21\/j-j-cleared-of-responsibility-for-woman-s-talc-cancer-claim\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>many cases<\/strong><\/a><strong>,<\/strong> it’s been cleared of any wrongdoing.<br\/><br\/>While talc suits have largely centered around J&J, it’s not alone.
