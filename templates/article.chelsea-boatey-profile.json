When I moved to the States in 2012, I realized there was a light-skinned and dark-skinned division within the community, which I was never privy to. My mom and sister are both light skinned and I grew up around a lot of people who were lighter. I was never made to feel bad about having darker skin, and didn’t realize how much it was a thing until coming to New York in 2016. But luckily, being from Ghana has made me feel empowered by having dark skin. I embrace my skin. I think it's my power. It’s something that makes me stand out. The darker I get, the more beautiful I think that I am. Being from Ghana has truly made me more confident in my skin.
