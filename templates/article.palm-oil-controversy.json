One organization that’s been instrumental in getting the industry to be open and more involved in finding solutions is the <a href=\"https:\/\/rspo.org\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil<\/strong><\/a>, or RSPO. It’s a multi-stakeholder platform that helps to promote the growth and use of sustainable palm oils through a global standard that growers and companies are expected to follow.<\/p><p>This includes 163 rules that range from abstaining from destructive sourcing, to “best practices about how much fertilizer to use and what the living conditions look like for the workers,” says Dan Strechay, RSPO director of outreach and engagement. Obtaining an RSPO certification has become the leading international sustainability standard and often indicates that a company is doing its due diligence.<\/p>"}},"666b4932-95f1-4683-a5a1-ee0fc02ebb9d":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"EYES","desc":"<p>Two shadows created this multitonal golden eye: the satiny <a href=\"https:\/\/www.beautycounter.com\/product\/velvet-eyeshadow-palette-classic\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Beautycounter Velvet Eyeshadow<\/strong><\/a> in Penny and, for microsparkle, <a href=\"https:\/\/rstyle.me\/+J0TPO4uvV3Cz8xiazqw1lQ\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Hourglass Scattered Light Eyeshadow<\/strong><\/a> in Foil. <a href=\"https:\/\/rstyle.me\/+_P91q--FrFKnf2-LWYLCwQ\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Marc Jacobs Velvet Noir mascara<\/strong><\/a> emphasized lashes while Diorshow Brow Styler Ultra-Fine Precision <a href=\"https:\/\/rstyle.me\/+vYui6fH1T809tGTPyhVEQQ\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Brow Pencil<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/rstyle.me\/+gJHEu8KNg9HmuYBO9P6W-A\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Gel<\/strong><\/a> defined brows.<\/p><p> <br\/><\/p>"}}},"block_order":["1b32387f-bae1-4c5c-89f2-160bf8da96fc","666b4932-95f1-4683-a5a1-ee0fc02ebb9d"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/1_674e43f7-ff33-47c7-855c-8dae161f34db.jpg","link":"","author":"© Aaron Gekoski \/ WWF-US","placement":"row"}},"b81a4b14-d9ab-4c9e-8630-2cf61c430bcc":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":true,"title":"DEMAND TRANSPARENCY","text_center":"<p>While a certification is a great start, as Greenpeace USA’s Ruiz points out, the validity <a href=\"https:\/\/www.greenpeace.org\/malaysia\/publication\/2620\/burning-down-the-house-how-unilever-and-other-global-brands-continue-to-fuel-indonesias-fires\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>can be fuzzy<\/strong><\/a>.
