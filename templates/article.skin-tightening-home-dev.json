According to Peterson, it stimulates the facial muscles where said neurotoxin has blocked communication between the nerve and muscles and boosts circulation, which may allow for nutrients to be better delivered to the area. “That stimulation could be especially beneficial to those who have had years of neurotoxin injections that has caused the skin to thin,” notes Dr. Nazarian.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["6de46836-eea5-4520-becb-523a2d9de5e6","4a58793b-2277-4df1-b609-ba9a3f1da00f"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body_1_637a4774-fe15-4453-9788-661d8d2473fd.gif","link":"","author":"@stellasimona","placement":"row-reverse"}},"16560122349dad3ba4":{"type":"2col-large-image","disabled":true,"settings":{"left_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body_2_5d8b438c-06a6-4d21-9567-fa2f91dbfcaa.webp","link_left":"","right_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body_3_078d7ecd-fe0e-4df1-95c2-2057a137e633.webp","link_right":""}},"16438375133c6df828":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":false,"quotes":"‘‘ THE THINGS YOU DO AT HOME CAN HELP YOU REACH YOUR SKIN GOALS FASTER...  ’’","author_quotes":""}},"1659375683d3c2ccba":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"d3fe0f89-545b-4235-b18a-8be8d2eeb310":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"WHAT TO BUY:","desc":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/myshlf.us\/p-47027%20\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>NuFace<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong>is an FDA-cleared microcurrent toning device touted by renowned aestheticians like Joanna Czech and<strong> <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.shanidarden.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Shani Darden<\/strong><\/a><strong>, <\/strong>an esthetician whose clients include January Jones and Jessica Alba.
