According to board-certified dermatologist Dr. Loretta Ciraldo, an ideal oil-control protocol includes cleansing your skin twice a day, exfoliating a few times per week to help unclog pores and balance skin oils (opt for an exfoliating cleanser with salicylic acid) and finishing with an oil-free moisturizer. <\/p><p>Most importantly, Dr. Ciraldo recommends avoiding or minimizing the use of drying skincare products such as acne ones containing high concentrations of benzoyl peroxide, glycolic and salicylic acids and ethyl\/denatured alcohol. These can cause the skin to overproduce skin oils to compensate. In other words, drying ingredients equals oilier skin.<br\/><br\/><\/p>"}},"0d5a8387-47bd-4669-87d4-67d30d1269df":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"use powder strategically","desc":"<p>To tone down oiliness throughout the day, Clint Brock<strong>,<\/strong> makeup artist and MODA brush artist, says powder is the easiest way to touch up your makeup. \"I would recommend a mattifying powder,\" he says. \"It's a great way for you to get rid of the shine and look flawless.\" Specifically, he suggests a powder that contains corn starch, which helps absorb oil and shine.
