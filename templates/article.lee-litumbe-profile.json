I hated my job. I hated my life. There were so many things that I wanted to change. I had no intention of actually living and being based in Dakar—it was just one stop for me. But then I came to Dakar, and so much about what I experienced allowed me to tap into a level of creativity that was new for me that I enjoy. That was the reason why I kept coming back and why I eventually chose to partially be based here.<br\/><br\/>What I liked about Dakar in particular was that it is modern, while also being traditional. I feel like I'm within a strong and traditionally West African culture, while still being able to enjoy a modern twist. For example, it's very common to see everyone dressed in traditional garb, like boubous in bright colors, and scarves. In Dakar, you pair that with being able to go to a cafe and order an avocado toast.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["2ff41739-ef20-4792-adb0-abefb97bb950","08e73282-b1b5-4ca6-b740-032624cc6d03","9c87c2d3-d5ff-4364-99a8-04f03b34a50e"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/1_a4b51ffa-00a5-4d65-95dc-d4f1ec10f597.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row-reverse"}},"1664896945a47e6738":{"type":"1col-text-dropcap","blocks":{"59eb3103-2f56-4815-814b-4f306fdecb6c":{"type":"text","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>Why is travel important to you?<\/p>"}},"f6b78979-1f60-4f1b-9abb-cc7bfc6b6372":{"type":"text","settings":{"dropcap":"LL:","description":"<p>In general, travel helps you to understand yourself better and helps to expand your mind.
