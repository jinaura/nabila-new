What is your belief? What is your culture?’ From that, I can start doing my makeup.”<\/p><p>Fast forward a decade and taking a chance has paid dividends: James’ artistry can be seen in <em>Vogue Italia<\/em>, <em>L'Officiel Paris<\/em>, and <em>Harper’s Bazaar<\/em>; his client roster includes Kendall Jenner and Carolyn Murphy; he’s worked on campaigns for Dior and Louis Vuitton; and he is an ambassador Marc Jacobs Beauty.

Whilst undeniably beautiful, translation is tricky. “It’s the skin,” James says about the focal point of this glowing look. “It's like skin under the sun, but not at noon, more like 6 or 7 p.m.”<\/p>"}},"16578253117cd181dc":{"type":"2col-simage-limage","settings":{"placement":"row-reverse","image1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/golden_hour_2.webp","link_1":"","author1":"","image2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/golden_hour_3.gif","link_2":"","video_url":"","custom_video_url":"","author2":""}},"1657906990cdc6d34a":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"BEHIND THIS LOOK:","text_center":"<p>“I kept the skin very natural, very pure, with a little touch of color on the cheekbones,” James says about Kunakey’s complexion for this look.
