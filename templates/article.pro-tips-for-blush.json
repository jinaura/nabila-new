At any moment you could find her penning empowering cover stories for prestigious publications like<em> i-D <\/em>and <em>Elle<\/em>, keeping it real on her Instagram Live talk show <em>Your Favorite Auntie <\/em>or hosting a revolving door of on-camera and public speaking engagements. The kicker? No matter the agenda item, you can expect Carlos to do it in a stunning sartorial look. While living and working stylishly is definitely a calling card for this former <em>Vogue<\/em> editor, making time for self-care has also become non-negotiable for showing up as her best self every day. “For me, self-care is a way of saying to myself, ‘You deserve more and that’s okay,’” she tells Rose Inc. “It’s my way of telling myself that I don’t always have to be on and producing something—that I deserve [rest].”<\/p><p>All in all, Carlos feels her best when she’s following her own path, no matter what. “It’s a very visceral experience,” she shares. And true to that path comes with setting healthy boundaries. “I now see boundaries as a super important form of self-care,” she explains. “For so long, as a Black woman occupying white spaces, I felt I had to be a certain way. Now, if I feel like I’m being taken advantage of or not getting all that I’ve worked for, I speak up about it.” Here, Carlos expands further on how her idea of self-care takes many different forms, from lighting candles to simply taking the time to listen to her favorite podcasts. She details her own beauty journey influenced by her Texas upbringing and stacked with lessons on embracing her hair (while looking to icons like<strong> <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/traceeellisross\/?hl=en\/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/traceeellisross\/?hl=en\/\"><strong>Tracee Ellis Ross<\/strong><\/a><strong> <\/strong>for inspiration) and using her platform to uplift people of color in fashion and beauty.<\/p>"}},"16391019784c81622d":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"b3e1d500-0a44-4488-b638-2ce4d7d2f931":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"THE BENEFITS\/CLAIMS:","desc":"<p>This newer-to-market category appeals to an age-old conundrum: How to push <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/blogs\/content\/how-to-layer-skin-care-products\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>concentrated active ingredients<\/strong><\/a> into the skin without stimulating the wound-healing defense (like with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/blogs\/content\/how-to-microneedling-benefits-guide-vanessa-lee-rn\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>microneedling<\/strong><\/a>, for example).<br\/><br\/><\/p>"}},"a87299e5-c4b7-499b-b187-915a3169aed9":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"WHO IT'S GOOD FOR:","desc":"<p>Theoretically, all skin types and concerns can benefit from more targeted skincare application, but those with with dry skin may particularly benefit.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["b3e1d500-0a44-4488-b638-2ce4d7d2f931","a87299e5-c4b7-499b-b187-915a3169aed9"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/download_ea8feb11-eaba-41a7-815d-a9d2f937cee4.jpg","author":"@dropletteinc","placement":"row"}},"1638825624650a93ab":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"WHAT TO BUY:","text_center":"<p>Three category-leading models have launched in the past six months alone: <a href=\"https:\/\/myshlf.us\/p-47029\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Réduit<\/strong><\/a>, a sleek new launch from former Foreo CEO, Paul Peros, that adopts an ultrasonic drug delivery tech used for 20 years in Australia and delivers vaporized actives to the skin via a device and pods (which contain 40 applications each);<strong> <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/myshlf.us\/p-47030\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Droplette<\/strong><\/a>, which tapped grant money from NASA to develop its tool and delivers topical treatments via a mist of sub-micron droplets; and<strong> <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/myshlf.us\/p-47032\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Foreo UFO 2<\/strong><\/a>, a device that pairs pre-programmed pulsations, heating, cooling, and\/or LED light with sheet masks to better drive actives into the skin.<\/p>"}},"1639359785f918ec7e":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"HOW TO USE:","text_center":"<p>Using Réduit's offering is as intuitive as snapping in your preferred skin-care pod, pressing a button, and hovering the device over your face for a minute.

But smaller doesn’t always mean better. “Just because something isn’t absorbed doesn’t mean it doesn’t have an effect on the skin,” notes Dr. Palm, who cites growth factors and hyaluronic acid as examples of ingredients that are too large to traverse the skin barrier, but still improve overall hydration by creating cell-signaling pathways.<br\/><br\/>Overall, more research is needed before our skin pros will sign off on these devices. “Though Droplette has some in-house clinicals and before-and-after photos <a href=\"https:\/\/droplette.io\/pages\/clinical-trials\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>published<\/strong><\/a>, these products lack published, reproducible clinical studies on patients and truly cosmeceutical-grade evidence. “I don’t think they’re harmful,” sys Dr. Palm. “The idea is interesting, but good science needs to be demonstrated in full-scale trials before I would recommend them to patients.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["666b4932-95f1-4683-a5a1-ee0fc02ebb9d"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/download_2.jpg","author":"","placement":"row-reverse"}},"relatedstories":{"type":"article-related-stories","settings":{}}},"order":["main","16353724683d856b0a","16391019784c81622d","1638825624650a93ab","1639359785f918ec7e","16353730788751ed1d","1635376222a775bae4","163936007001db3f37","relatedstories"]}
