The solution: Do your skincare routine at night and focus only on your basic skin prep (i.e., wash the face and eyelids using a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/collections\/skin\/products\/skin-clarity-gentle-exfoliating-cleanser\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>cleanser<\/strong><\/span><\/a> and follow that with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/products\/hydration-replenish-microencapsulated-moisturizer\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>moisturizer<\/strong><\/span><\/a> and sunscreen) in the morning before makeup application.

And when using it, a little bit goes a long way. “Apply a few small dots onto [the] eyelids and blend with fingertips or a small brush,” she says. <br\/><br\/><\/p>"}},"9e84304e-dd68-4cfe-a65b-7b519bcc005a":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"Red Hair","desc":"<p>While product shades such as red and auburn are typically marketed towards redheads, La Rose advises against them because they tend not to look as natural.
