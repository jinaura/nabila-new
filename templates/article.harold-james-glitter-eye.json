The lights were super ugly in the beginning, turned beautiful at the end. It's what I wanted to express with this eye, because when you're having fun with your friends, everything can turn beautiful.”<\/p>"}},"1646856043dbfb4347":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"Behind This Look:","text_center":"<p>For a bold eye look, save complexion products for last. “I started by framing the eyes with a dark blue eyeshadow, because if you don't do this, you don't have the intensity,” James says, noting that a pigmented base is vital when using bold sparkles or chunky glitter. Using a wet brush and Byredo Prismic Palette, he layered color over Kunakey’s lids.“I created a kind of large cat-eye,”James says. “Then I applied a little glue where I needed the sparkles and put them on. I go step-by-step because, of course, if you apply the glue all over, it's going to dry. The secret is not to apply too much sparkle, otherwise, it's too heavy.”(Be sure to only use glitter and sparkles designed for the eyes—not craft store glitter, which can cause irritation or injury.)
