But generally, blush should be applied to the apples of the cheeks for a subtle flush of color. To apply blush, Lerma asks her clients to smile and then gently sweeps the product on the apples of the cheek using a fluffy, tapered brush. If there’s excess product on the brush, she’ll then swipe it on the forehead and the bridge of the nose to bring it all together.<\/p><p>Bronzer adds warmth to the face. For the best placement, Lerma recommends applying it strategically on the outskirts of the face using a round tapered brush, which deposits the product with precision. “I apply bronzer with a sweeping motion in the shape of the number three on the outskirts of the face,” she says. Then chisel the cheekbones and finish by curving the bronzer onto the jawline. <\/p>"}}},"block_order":["54c31f46-8df8-4052-8122-5ac757d45d41"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/220429_RoseInc_Solar22_Shot3_Highlight_Macrotexture_004_V3_AP_Crop.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row-reverse"}},"16594706917514817c":{"type":"product-set-carousel","settings":{"title":"SHOP THE STORY","desc":"","collection":"","dots":true,"arrows":true}},"1658782848b2ec4091":{"type":"product-collection-carousel-module","blocks":{"1f3b96e1-110b-4241-841a-2e20bb5f916b":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"solar-radiance-hydrating-cream-highlighter"}},"c777ed46-89ae-40fa-b257-a3a9e60e46f7":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"highlighter-brush"}},"a6598c6c-c948-4640-9d6e-9469805f7569":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"divine-color-blush-brush-set"}},"482bfd2d-d477-4ba7-be83-7318ba1d4981":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"solar-infusion-soft-focus-cream-bronzer"}},"af433b3d-1473-4cb0-ab1c-5ee9a5d7a6b6":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"bronzer-brush"}}},"block_order":["1f3b96e1-110b-4241-841a-2e20bb5f916b","c777ed46-89ae-40fa-b257-a3a9e60e46f7","a6598c6c-c948-4640-9d6e-9469805f7569","482bfd2d-d477-4ba7-be83-7318ba1d4981","af433b3d-1473-4cb0-ab1c-5ee9a5d7a6b6"],"settings":{"carousel_type":"grid_carousel","title":"","desc":"<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
