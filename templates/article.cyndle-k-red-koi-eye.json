They found themselves in the Imperial Palace Garden in Tokyo and spotted these koi fish. “I love the colors and textures,” Cyndle says, so she reimagined a classic cat-eye with a fin-like swoop in a daring red and yellow color combination. The result is elegant, refined, and wholly unexpected.<\/p>"}},"16469532296993ac1e":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"Behind This Look:","text_center":"<p><strong>“<\/strong>I wanted to keep the skin light and fresh to keep the focus on the eye,” Cyndle says, so she opted for a semi-sheer base: Chanel Les Beiges Water Fresh Tint in Light plus a little Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder over her T-zone. “Generally, I try to keep a balance of being a little undone if one [part of the face] is very <em>done<\/em>,” she says. “So there is a relaxed nature to it.” With her minimal complexion protocol finished, she moved onto her eyes.<\/p>"}},"1646953293b2213be8":{"type":"2col-simage-limage","settings":{"placement":"row-reverse","image1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/download_1_db31edec-3e17-4637-94bb-24aee1047c8e.jpg","link_1":"","author1":"","image2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/download_2_424f9603-7656-4221-9a6e-51a8c5e63375.jpg","link_2":"","video_url":"","custom_video_url":"","author2":""}},"16469532968af086b2":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":false,"quotes":"\"I wanted it to feel less like a cat-eye and more like a little swoop…\"","author_quotes":""}},"16469533582bbac6b1":{"type":"1col-image-video","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/download_3_f53e5d5e-8879-4f55-bfdd-20fbf159c048.jpg","link":"","video_url":"","custom_video_url":"","author":""}},"16469533616b550ebb":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"","text_center":"<p>“Building the texture is important,” Cyndle notes, so she first reached for Chanel Stylo Yeux Waterproof Long-Lasting Eyeliner in Eros, a burgundy color she calls an all-time favorite. “It's easier to get a punch if you layer shadow over pencil.” After lining her upper and lower waterlines, she began to sketch out an upturned shape. “I wanted it to feel less like a cat-eye and more like a little swoop,” she says. Pro tip: Start your swoop at the bottom lashline, not top, for more overall curve. “Even going into the center of the lid using the eyeliner will give you a really clean, precise line,” she says. Manipulate with cotton buds as needed.<br\/><br\/>Once she had her outline in place, Cyndle moved on to Huda Beauty Obsessions Eyeshadow Palette in Ruby. “Use a flat eyeshadow brush to trace over the liner with the shadow,” she says. “I stuck to the pinky-red tones to create an elongated shape to mirror the tail of the fish.” Continue building your color into the crease if you haven’t already, she says. <a href=\"https:\/\/stagemakeuponline.com\/products\/ben-nye-lumiere-grand-colour-pressed-eye-shadow?variant=32011569234051&gclid=CjwKCAiAudD_BRBXEiwAudakX6aGxLN02bSMvkkzNB3NvLQRUXu78QYTjT6m4V0ksFV0ysS3kEkUWhoCNawQAvD_BwE\">Ben Nye Eye Shadow<\/a> in Sun Yellow provided the contrast. “I kept the center of the lid more bare so that the yellow eyeshadow would pop,” she says. “You can even spray your brush so that it's a little damp and then press on the yellow pigment to have even more of an impact.” A few coats of Chanel Le Volume Stretch de Chanel Mascara finished her eyes.<br\/><br\/>“I wanted the lip color to have the same tone,” Cyndle says, so she used Ilia Balmy Gloss Tinted Lip Oil in Saint. “It's pretty sheer so your natural color comes through, just a little bitten to keep that balance of the face.”<br\/><br\/>Cyndle K photographed by Stas Komarovski.
