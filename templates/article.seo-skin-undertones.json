As Callazo puts it, skin tones refer to the skin’s surface color, while skin undertones are the subtle hues that live underneath. Another way to look at it: skin undertones have more to do with the skin’s temperature. So, while your skin tone can slightly change from season to season, your skin undertone always remains the same.<\/p><p>Skin undertones are separated into three main categories: warm, cool and neutral. “If you were to split the color wheel in half, you'll find warm shades that feel like sunshine and heat on one side, and cool shades that feel cold and icy on the other,” Collazo says. “Undertones of the skin will typically fall somewhere on the spectrum of warm (more yellow), cool (more blue), or neutral (more red\/pink).”<br\/><br\/><\/p>"}},"5a4df479-125a-4aba-b67e-436ecf7a7f2e":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Why knowing your skin undertone is important","desc":"<p>So, why is determining your skin undertone necessary? For one, it ensures you achieve seamless makeup application. “Unless you are experimental or edgy, contrasting undertones can look off on the skin,” Hoffman says. “It really is all about trying to see what works best for you.” Plus, knowing your skin’s undertone makes it much easier to shop for complexion products both in-store and online. <\/p><p>Knowing your undertone also makes it easier to shop for other color cosmetics, such as a blush or red lipstick that complement your skin tone. “[It becomes] a much simpler task grounded in science versus being a veritable guessing game,” Collazo says. Furthermore, “unlocking this skill has an overwhelmingly positive effect on the overall outcome of your makeup look, and can even translate into other areas of your life, from picking your wardrobe, desired hair color, and even how you choose to decorate your home.”<br\/><br\/><\/p>"}}},"block_order":["47046ca8-e320-47e7-a76c-bc349079eafe","5a4df479-125a-4aba-b67e-436ecf7a7f2e"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/highlighter-body-1_c4b1ee1f-5b07-4a48-af9d-c552893eda18.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row-reverse"}},"16571245022b4ff11c":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":true,"quotes":"How to determine your skin undertones","author_quotes":""}},"165428408577d8063a":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"fe367adc-afba-4e2a-a4a5-9868a3d2814e":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"How to determine your skin undertones","desc":""}},"2839148e-96d7-453e-b8ce-8314cc5e7280":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Do the vein test","desc":"<p>There are a few tests out there to determine your skin’s undertone.
