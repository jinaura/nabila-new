Switch to a thicker moisturizer","desc":"<p>Moisturizing the skin is what helps keep it plump and healthy, preventing it from drying out and in turn, preventing sagging and wrinkling, Hassani says. When it gets cold, however, Dr. Levin says the skin tends to get dryer and, therefore, more easily irritated. Warmer showers can also lead to skin barrier disruption, worsening dryness and irritation. For these reasons, Dr. Levin and Hassani recommend switching to a thicker body moisturizer during the fall. Dr. Levin points to body <em>creams,<\/em> specifically, which contain a higher oil content than lotions, making them thicker and more hydrating for the skin.<\/p><p>That said, Hassani notes that this does depend on where you live and your skin type. If you live somewhere with primarily warm weather year-round (like Southern California, for instance), sticking to your regular body moisturizer should suffice.<br\/><br\/><\/p>"}},"377d77f6-b295-49e4-bd68-127ab4d9c5ea":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"2.

Dr. Levin recommends decreasing the frequency of exfoliation from every day during the summer to two to three times per week during the fall to help modulate changes in the weather.
