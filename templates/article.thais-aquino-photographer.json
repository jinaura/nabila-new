I think this phase of my life gave me enormous confidence to pursue even more passionately what is mine to say, do and create. Of course, I had mentors throughout my life that offered me structure, alignment and helped me create a path to follow, but my confidence only came when I learned how to say ‘no,’ how to draw boundaries and ask for what I needed.

At the end of the photo shoot, we went to celebrate at a restaurant and she looked at herself in the mirror and was surprised by her appearance — she didn’t fully recognize herself. I remember saying to her, “Yeah, it’s incredible how the art of makeup can reveal so much.”  She replied back, “Oh, really? I thought it was meant to hide so much.” From that day on, I’ve been allowing myself more and more to be re-introduced to makeup as play, calling on archetypes and expressions through this new perception of “creating\/revealing” something, rather than “fixing\/hiding.” When I do wear makeup, the Rose Inc blush is my absolute favorite. <\/p>"}},"97fab91a-9296-474a-8cef-943054cfa92b":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>What is your approach to skincare?<\/p>"}},"e0095f05-3558-41c2-ad8b-dd1dfd6d8d49":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"TA:","description":"<p>I have dry skin. body oils and a good face serum will always accompany me everywhere I go.
