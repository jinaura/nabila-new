You can't be walking around like this. You're beautiful, but you need to put on makeup.’ I remember going through my mom's makeup bag trying to figure out my foundation shade. But again, my mom's lighter than me. Once I moved to the States, I started going to the MAC beauty counter because they were the only ones that carried darker shades at the time. I remember going on YouTube and trying to follow tutorials as well.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["f83227d2-94bc-4bfd-b486-65f3acb32111","ea5710ea-cea4-4362-b014-9d6a5eaa143a","fafeeda8-f8b1-43e1-81fa-5b074edac818","72eb0234-5805-4c75-8bd8-0548d5fdad14"],"disabled":true,"settings":{"full_width":false}},"1662063635c64ac404":{"type":"product-set-carousel","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"","desc":"","collection":"","dots":true,"arrows":true}},"166489411808e310b1":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":true,"title":"OPT FOR DROPS","text_center":"<p>“I love using the<a href=\"https:\/\/www.jamesreadtan.com\/james-read-h2o-tan-drops-body-45ml.html\" target=\"_blank\">J ames Read H2O Tan Drops <\/a>that you can put in your moisturizer, foundation, tinted moisturiser, or SPF,” Ferrer says. “You will get the color that you would from a foundation or bronzer without having to wear any makeup and it doesn’t transfer at all.
