But I loved seeing my mom and aunts sewing my sister’s regalia. I saw firsthand the detail and work that goes into it. It was beautiful to think of how all of the different colors and each ribbon symbolizes something. That’s when I understood that fashion is more than just about aesthetics. There's really a lot of intention and thought that can go into it. That’s what made me fall in love with fashion. It took me a few years to realize that, but now I'm constantly calling my mom and my aunts every other day to say, ‘can you make me this?’ So now I'm so into the design process.<\/p>"}},"f1001a7c-275e-4cfb-b0c7-b65e57ab8f54":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>What inspired you to write your book, “The Power of Style”?<\/p>"}},"5b4c3f9a-de9e-4718-9b65-65df1eb4b86d":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"CA:","description":"<p>I began thinking about how, as a teen, I didn't really see my Indigenous culture reflected in fashion.
