For Pati Dubroff, being ‘down to earth’ isn’t a passing platitude, it’s a lifestyle of yoga and meditation that’s grounded her through 34 years as a professional makeup artist, a feat reserved for only a select few who balance refined talent with emotional perseverance and mental flexibility.<\/p><p>“I'm really lucky that I found it and it found me,” Dubroff says. “There's no way that I could do what I do without the centeredness.” With a storied background working under greats like Francois Nars; a star-studded client roster that includes Margot Robbie, Priyanka Chopra, and Laura Dern; and a gig as a Chanel Makeup Artist, Dubroff is one of the most prolific artists of the time. For these reasons and more, Rose Inc. is delighted to feature Dubroff as this month’s Artist in Residency.<\/p><p>This month, things are personal. Dubroff found inspiration for her residency in a tattoo inked on her wrist: Shapes that form a daily reminder of the elements that keep her grounded. With Earth, Water, Air, and Fire in mind, she dreamt up modern looks, then artfully brought them to life on a first-time model she’s known for 16 years: her daughter, Bianca.<\/p>"}},"d0bfde02-696b-456e-ad3b-a117737bc805":{"type":"2col-simage-limage","settings":{"placement":"row","image1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Elevates_Glitter_6.webp","link_1":"","author1":"","image2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Elevates_Glitter_2.webp","link_2":"","video_url":"","custom_video_url":"","author2":""}},"f471836b-6c50-405b-977e-be939e17cbc3":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":true,"title":"HER RESIDENCY INSPIRATION:","text_center":"<p>Radiant.
