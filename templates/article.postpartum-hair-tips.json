She leaned into eggs, berries, spinach, fatty fish, sweet potatoes, avocados, nuts, and seeds and cut out high-mercury fish, sugar, and high glycaemic foods, she says. “They provide a good source of protein, biotin, omegas 3 and 6, and fatty acids that help to strengthen the hair cuticle and nourish the scalp.”<\/p><p>In terms of supplements, Brook recommends talking to your healthcare provider to see if you’re a candidate for adding things like biotin, collagen, iron, zinc, and vitamin D. “My favorite is subscription service <a href=\"https:\/\/perelelhealth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Perelel<\/strong><\/a> because regardless of where you are in your motherhood journey, they pair you with the right subscriptions to match your nutritional needs,” she says. Then, for specific supplements, she swears by <a href=\"https:\/\/shoremagic.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Shore Magic Hydrolyzed Marine Collagen Protein<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/myshlf.us\/p-88126\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Nue Co Plant Protein<\/strong><\/a>.
