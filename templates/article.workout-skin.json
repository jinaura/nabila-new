Potent doses of skin care actives like vitamin C, benzoyl peroxide, and retinol may cause skin to become irritated during a workout, depending on your chemistry and exercise conditions. Applying a vitamin C serum before going on an outdoor run on a sunny day, for example, may cause temporary severe redness and a burning sensation. <\/p>"}}},"block_order":["b3e1d500-0a44-4488-b638-2ce4d7d2f931"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/kelsey-curtis-kD9qprR6HBI-unsplash_8b20d3da-ce94-4875-83ad-82cde5cc2de4.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row"}},"1646362489a2e7621e":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"","text_center":"<p><br\/>“You don’t want to provoke any kind of reaction,” Ford says, “So keep it simple.

Here’s why: “Sweating itself, when followed up with cleansing, helps to rinse the pores from the inside out,” explains Dr. Guanche  “Sweating promotes the ‘pushing’ of keratin out of the pores, so the ideal situation is a hot sweaty workout, steam shower, and then a soothing facial to extract blackheads and whiteheads.” <br\/><br\/>If a full-on facial may not be possible <em>après<\/em> sweat, even just adding a swipe of salicylic acid helps minimize congestion, Dr. Guanche says—especially when wearing a mask.
