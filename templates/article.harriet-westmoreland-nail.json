Years later, Westmoreland reimagined the classic look in her mind—a fine line of color that hugged her nail’s short, square edge—but couldn’t find a nail tech who could bring it to life exactly the way she wanted, so she set out to create it herself. “In the beginning it would take me hours to do the French,” she recalls. “I couldn't get it right for such a long time, but here we are!”<\/p><p>Soon enough the self-taught artist was getting requests from friends and then eventually, strangers. With two young sons at home, turning her passion into a flexible profession made a lot of sense. Fast forward a few years and the Yorkshire-based artist has worked her way from salons to London-based private clients and has big aspirations for her own product line. Her work, best described as modern, minimal, and meticulous, is sophistication for the Instagram era.<\/p><p>For these reasons and more, Rose Inc. is delighted to welcome Westmoreland as our very first <em>nail<\/em> artist in residency.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["839e3029-b434-4b59-9f68-28b457cd4f25"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body_1_3a8a9866-1003-468b-bdc1-11ac78b3b396.webp","link":"","author":"","placement":"row"}},"16593894477665ede8":{"type":"2col-simage-limage","settings":{"placement":"row","image1":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body_3_39446384-6b0e-41cf-829a-10d85a261b02.webp","link_1":"","author1":"","image2":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body_2_a946f17a-67ff-4e3a-af40-45af065f617b.webp","link_2":"","custom_video_url":"","author2":""}},"16438375133c6df828":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":false,"quotes":"‘‘ SHORT, SOFT-SQUARE NAILS ARE VERY FLATTERING FOR ALL NAIL SHAPES.  ’’","author_quotes":""}},"16593881130899e609":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"BEHIND THIS LOOK:","text_center":"<p>A perfect manicure begins by avoiding an old-school protocol: soaking. “My manicures are <em>always<\/em> dry,” Westmoreland says. “If you soak your skin, it can be difficult to see if the stuff you're trimming is dead or alive.” Plus, it can swell the nail and cause premature chipping, she says, so remove any excess nail polish, wash hands thoroughly, and begin your nail care with dry hands.<\/p><p>Cuticle clean-up comes first for Westmoreland, for which she recommends<strong> <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/myshlf.us\/p-29291\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Navy Doris Tool<\/strong><\/a> to gently push back any dead skin on the nail plate and the brand’s <a href=\"https:\/\/myshlf.us\/p-29294\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Katey Super Fine Nips<\/strong><\/a> to remove it. “The white, clear skin that you can push back is okay to trim as long as you're not trimming excessively or cutting away anything that’s alive,” she says. “Once a month is fine.”<\/p>"}},"16593882691b5cff85":{"type":"1col-image-video","disabled":true,"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body_4_70579d90-4b85-44f1-8168-0555daf75a7b.webp","link":"","video_url":"","custom_video_url":"","author":""}},"16593895612241c26d":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"61d7dab6-652e-463e-b75f-f94c6ba339dc":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"","desc":"<p>Next comes shaping.
