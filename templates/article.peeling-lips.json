Avoid triggers","text_center":"<p>Dr. King points to allergens and irritants in foods, as well as topical products, as other causes. For this reason, she recommends taking note of foods you ate or products you used before the lip peeling started to help identify any triggers. If an allergy is suspected, an allergist can also perform a patch test to confirm. The cold weather and wind can also trigger peeling lips, so Dr. King recommends protecting your lips by covering them with a mask or scarf when you're outside.<\/p>"}},"1643079436398d7e31":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"4.

Avoid drying ingredients","desc":"<p>When it comes to lip peeling, the products and ingredients you <em>don't<\/em> put on your lips are equally as important as what you do apply.

However, Dr. King says when lips are already sensitive, salicylic acid can lead to further irritation.<br\/><br\/>And it's not just lip balms and other lip moisturizers. Be sure to check the ingredient list of other lip products you're using, such as liner, gloss and lipstick in case they contain potentially drying or irritating ingredients. Dr. King notes that lip plumping products often contain cinnamon oil or peppermint oil, which can cause irritation as well.<br\/><br\/><br\/><\/p>"}},"3f0a3bbe-402a-4f1d-af41-639266f3567b":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"6.

If there is still no improvement, then it may be time to visit a board-certified dermatologist for personalized treatment.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["323722db-3555-4246-adee-74bfe0ab8a8c","3f0a3bbe-402a-4f1d-af41-639266f3567b"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/2302_LIP_TREATMENT_PRODUCT_SUPPORTING_LINDSEY_LULUMCARDLE_SHOT9_0002_V7_AP_CROP.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row-reverse"}},"5df4227b-a84f-4483-95bb-c369107fddde":{"type":"product-set-carousel","settings":{"title":"Shop Bestsellers","desc":"<p>Shop Rose Inc's clean, hydrating essentials powered by biotechnology. <\/p>","collection":"","dots":true,"arrows":true}},"16430534480b8622ba":{"type":"product-collection-carousel-module","blocks":{"7395c6f1-a30c-476b-9ee7-df1b27a9cda3":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"lip-treatment-hydrating-lip-balm"}},"47e1d806-fac7-4259-9620-25630a538387":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"satin-lip-set"}},"0fcdf6f8-df0f-457d-a1f5-8ec3353e0db3":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"lip-sculpt"}},"10d83656-ebf8-43d7-b1ea-831922fcc4e1":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"cream-blush"}},"97b4467e-6872-487f-a805-f03e1809ca8a":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"reusable-makeup-pad-10-count"}}},"block_order":["7395c6f1-a30c-476b-9ee7-df1b27a9cda3","47e1d806-fac7-4259-9620-25630a538387","0fcdf6f8-df0f-457d-a1f5-8ec3353e0db3","10d83656-ebf8-43d7-b1ea-831922fcc4e1","97b4467e-6872-487f-a805-f03e1809ca8a"],"settings":{"carousel_type":"grid_carousel","title":"","desc":"","collection":"","dots":true,"arrows":true}},"relatedstories":{"type":"article-related-stories","settings":{}}},"order":["main","16391019784c81622d","1645832712bbc0a462","1643079222f5e34bf5","1643079274a50bcc43","1643079436398d7e31","16458331836d6311a5","5df4227b-a84f-4483-95bb-c369107fddde","16430534480b8622ba","relatedstories"]}
