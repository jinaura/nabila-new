Nicknamed “Hollywood’s green makeup artist,” she’s cultivated a loyal following—Olivia Wilde, January Jones, and Olivia Munn are just a few of her A-list clients—for both her artistry and love of natural products and holistic treatments. “You never know what's going to happen on the road with a client,” Denno says. “I've whipped up a lot of solutions at the 11th hour on a press junket, from cold spoons on the eyes to a yogurt mask.”<br\/><br\/>This month, Rose Inc. has tapped Denno for something special: A mini series of four at-home beauty treatments. By utilizing natural fruit enzymes for exfoliation, the antibacterial properties of honey and apple cider vinegar, and more ingredient superfoods you probably already have on hand, she created easy weekly indulgences to keep our faces and scalps healthy while self-isolating—and yes, they’re great for making memories with family, too.<\/p>"}},"a3341c77-2e22-49ca-b5ea-bb6a17596740":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"edcdac87-e97e-431d-b000-43282c5c3406":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"HER DIY INSPIRATION:","desc":"<p>Coconut oil to protect.
