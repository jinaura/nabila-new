It’s for these reasons and more we are delighted to welcome Anete back to Rose Inc for her second Artist in Residency.<br\/><br\/><\/p>"}},"59b8d16d-b7b1-4a52-aba5-b0a677508a42":{"type":"text","disabled":true,"settings":{"title":"HER RESIDENCY INSPIRATION:","desc":"<p>Anete has been feeling especially drawn to bold, multicolored accents this summer — and translated to the face, it can take on unexpected forms. “Maybe it’s the <em>Euphoria<\/em> effect?” she wonders.
