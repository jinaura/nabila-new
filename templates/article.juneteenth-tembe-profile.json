The key, she says, is to pat blush into the skin, not sweep. Sweeping can take too much off and move foundation coverage underneath.

Espinoza says highlight goes on the high plane of your cheek to add a spotlight to the top of the cheekbone and enhance that area. On the other hand, Milan says, bronzer goes just below the cheekbone area to help sculpt the face. Making a kissy face will make it easier to find the hollow area below the cheekbone.<\/p>"}},"9b70070c-5812-4693-b2df-83684f9dc09d":{"type":"1col-text-center","disabled":true,"settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"Heading","text_center":"<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.

For dry skin, Espinoza recommends liquid or cream blushes to add a youthful glow.  For oily skin, he suggests powder blushes;  the skin's natural oils already provide a dewy look.
