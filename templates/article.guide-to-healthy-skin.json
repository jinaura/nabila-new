SLEEP LIKE YOUR LOOKS DEPEND ON IT.","text_center":"<p>Because they do. “We're not getting enough quality sleep,” Dr. Talib says. “That causes an imbalance in the hormone cortisol, which then causes full-on hormonal issues,” she says. And “issues” is a polite way to put it. Elevated cortisol levels are associated with stress, not to mention an increase in breakouts. (Those deep, stubborn pimples that pop up when you’re extremely stressed? Blame a spike in cortisol.)<\/p><p><br\/>So before applying all the topical acne treatments, try making sleep a priority. Around eight hours of uninterrupted sleep every night is a good goal, Dr. Talib says. “Go to sleep at the same time every night and get up at the same time every morning,” she advises. “That helps set your body’s internal clock much better.” Wise advice to remember the next time you’re considering a late-night Netflix binge.<\/p>"}},"16648974041ef23081":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":true,"title":"2. EAT LESS SUGAR, DAIRY, GLUTEN AND ALCOHOL.","text_center":"<p>“What people eat is going to be a huge part of how their skin changes,” Dr. Talib says. And as it turns out, cakes and candies are <em>terrific<\/em> for your skin. Just kidding, it’s the opposite. (But come on… you suspected as much, right?) “Every time you have sugar, inflammation happens in your skin,” Dr. Talib says. “That causes sagging, fine lines, and wrinkles.”<\/p><p><br\/>The root cause begins in your digestive system, where sugar interferes with the delicate balance of bacteria in your gut. “It’s kind of like Gremlins eating after midnight,” she says. “Sugar makes the bacteria go crazy and have a massive party at your expense. That overgrowth of bacteria causes an imbalance of your skin microbiome.” So the next time you crave something sweet, opt for low-glycemic fruits such as grapefruit, pears, cherries, or blueberries.<\/p><p><br\/>If you’re prone to acne, Dr. Talib recommends looking at your dairy consumption. “Cow's milk contains some hormones that contribute to acne and inflammation,” she says. (Indeed, <a href=\"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1111\/jdv.13835\" target=\"_blank\">recent<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/abs\/pii\/S0190962216301311\" target=\"_blank\">research<\/a> indicates that teenagers who consumed low-fat milk experienced more acne than their peers who did not.) “If you really want to get rid of the acne, you need to cut dairy out—at least for a bit,” she says. If you choose to replace dairy milk with a plant-based milk, choose unsweetened versions to avoid an unintentional sugar rush.<\/p><p><br\/>Gluten, too, can trigger skin problems. “It can cause dermatitis, increase the risk of pigmentation, and cause sensitivity to things you never used to be sensitive to,” Dr. Talib says. So pass on the croissant—and the wine, too, while you’re at it. Dr. Talib notes that even one glass can simultaneously trigger hormonal changes and dehydrate skin. Ideally, Dr. Talib says, you’ll swap out these foods for a diet that’s richer in vegetables—for about a month, at least. “It’s just about seeing how you feel for 30 days, and seeing how your skin looks,” she notes.<\/p>"}},"166490058928056974":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":true,"quotes":"‘‘ PEOPLE ARE USING WAY TOO MANY PRODUCTS  ’’","author_quotes":""}},"b81a4b14-d9ab-4c9e-8630-2cf61c430bcc":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":true,"title":"3.
