Growing up in New Jersey, she learned about skincare at an early age. “It was always about your skin and how well you took care of it,” she says, adding that her mother often made DIY products: a mix of cornmeal, shea butter and oil to create a face scrub or egg and avocado as a hair mask. “I grew up thinking avocados were only for your hair and not something you’re supposed to eat!” she says. Still, her most valuable lesson was inner confidence. “My mom always taught us to lean on something beyond our physical traits.”<\/p><p>Below, Jacques shares more about her beauty and wellness rituals as a working mother and community leader, her ideal Valentine’s Day date and so much more. <\/p>"}},"16391019784c81622d":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"2ff41739-ef20-4792-adb0-abefb97bb950":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>You’ve had such an impactful career in beauty so far.
