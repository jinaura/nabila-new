For larger areas of the body such as the legs, Persico advises sticking with bronzing lotions, which make application easier and more seamless. In general, Gabbay recommends going with bronzers that are meant to be used on the body. While a face bronzer may work on the body, it may not stay in place as well and can also run the risk of accidentally getting on your clothes. Bonus points if the bronzer also provides additional benefits, such as blurring out imperfections and revitalizing dull skin.<br\/><br\/><\/p>"}},"099ec7ab-227a-490b-beeb-eff309e2f48b":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Select the correct shade","desc":"<p>To create a cohesive look between your face and body, choosing the right shade of bronzer is key. \"Don't go super dark on [your] chest or body and leave your face lighter,\" Gabbay says. \"This will be an easy tell that you've gone too far.\" As a rule of thumb, she says, choose a bronzer shade that matches the one you apply on your face, which ideally should be one or two shades darker than your natural skin tone.<\/p><p>Also, note your skin's undertones when choosing the correct bronzer shade for the body. \"The more pigment in your skin, the warmer your bronzer can be,\" Persico says. \"A bronzer with a lot of warm\/red pigment in it is good to give darker skin a glow. If you're on the paler side, a light neutral bronze that looks almost [like] a cool beige will give you the color you're looking for without turning you orange.\"<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["bba85786-8863-4db3-85d1-adae28eaae7b","099ec7ab-227a-490b-beeb-eff309e2f48b"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body-1-choice-your-bronzershade.jpg","link":"","author":"","placement":"row-reverse"}},"90a73c98-1906-4977-a37c-bbf67dbdc938":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":false,"quotes":"\"Buff in lines using a large kabuki brush around your cleavage area in circular motions…”","author_quotes":""}},"f7078519-a09d-4dc1-a977-83ad6823569f":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"863e78c8-cd3c-4d5c-bc64-44005534d577":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Apply bronzer to your chest, collarbone and shoulders","desc":"<p>Start by applying bronzer in the natural hollows of the chest and neck to create a shadow effect. \"Buff in lines using a large kabuki brush around your cleavage area in circular motions; doing this will give the appearance of 'pushed up' cleavage, which is great if you are rocking a low-cut shirt or dress,\" Persico says.<\/p><p>Adding bronzer to the collarbone will also help create a more sculpted appearance. To find your collarbone, \"lightly jut your shoulders forward until you can see your bone structure,\" Persico says. Then place the bronzer underneath the high points of the bone structure. For an even more chiseled effect, Gabbay recommends adding bronzer above the collarbone too.<\/p><p>For shoulder application, the trick is to apply the bronzer where the sun naturally hits. \"Lightly brush the bronzer on the outside of your shoulders and on the inside of your clavicle bones using light circular motions,\" Persico says. If you're using a powder bronzer for the chest and shoulder area, Gabbay recommends using a bigger and fluffier brush that fits comfortably in the palm of your hand, which will make it easier to diffuse and blend the product.<\/p><p>If you’re still feeling intimidated by body bronzer application, remember it takes a bit of practice to nail down.
