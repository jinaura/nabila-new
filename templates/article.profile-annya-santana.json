It’s all about being natural and maybe doing a beat for a special occasion. We’re all about taking care of our skin and hair.

I think now it’s a lot easier to be free and explore whatever styles you want to do. Recently moving to France has made me embrace simple makeup tricks that I never really used to do before; I never really used to wear red lipstick and now I find myself wearing it a lot more. <\/p>"}},"9c87c2d3-d5ff-4364-99a8-04f03b34a50e":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>Describe your journey to confidence<\/p>"}},"a9e30dd6-8c18-4d63-be67-079af378d66d":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"AS:","description":"<p>Aging has been joyful.
