What is your belief? What is your culture?’ From that, I can start doing my makeup.”<\/p><p>Fast forward a decade and his risk leaving finance has paid dividends: James’ artistry can be seen in <em>Vogue Italia<\/em>, <em>L'Officiel Paris<\/em>, and <em>Harper’s Bazaar<\/em>; his client roster includes Kendall Jenner and Carolyn Murphy; and he’s worked on campaigns for Dior, Louis Vuitton, and Marc Jacobs Beauty, for which he is an ambassador.
