Ross recommends only exfoliating as part of your evening skincare routine order since exfoliation will make your skin more susceptible to the sun. And depending on how gently or intensely you exfoliate, he suggests doing it anywhere from once a week to once a month. Everyone’s skin is different, so make a note of what frequency works best for you.<\/p><p> <\/p>"}},"f272a95a-3e15-4377-b668-0e8467fe6756":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"3.

In particular, Ross suggests using a hydrating toner to infuse moisture and prep the skin for the rest of the products you’ll be applying as part of your morning and evening skincare routine. There are also antiseptic toners available, which remove excess dirt and bacteria. However, Ross doesn’t recommend them for adults. “If you’re suffering from adult acne, it’s not because your skin is dirty,” he says. “It’s because you have stress and inflammation, and antiseptic toners will only exacerbate the problem.”<\/p><p> <\/p>"}}},"block_order":["a430f549-0d74-4c64-9f42-1fdcaeec1577","4aec27a6-31c7-4828-8e52-8809fc15a693","ab9fc26a-48a7-4c66-a519-abd2d8684e5e","f272a95a-3e15-4377-b668-0e8467fe6756"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body-moisturizer-layer.gif","link":"","author":"","placement":"row"}},"1654621533d3fe19fc":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":true,"quotes":"“Serums are generally potent high concentrations of active ingredients...in a lighter formula to allow for a better product absorption....”","author_quotes":""}},"16509451889e6edbea":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"1c980084-1593-4524-b4bf-d003421e04a9":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"4.

Then, she says, wait for the serum to fully dry and soak into your skin for two to five minutes before moving on to the next step.
