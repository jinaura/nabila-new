Prep the lashes","desc":"<p>Before curling your lashes, it’s important to ensure that they’re clean first. If you have leftover mascara or lash glue that's hardened and crusted on, makeup artist Nikki La Rose warns that your lashes could be at risk of breaking or being damaged. To prep them for curling, La Rose recommends taking a Q-tip soaked with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/products\/micellar-cleanser\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong>micellar water<\/strong><\/span><\/a> and gently running it above and below the lashes.<br\/><br\/><\/p>"}},"e682a0e6-1aec-4d4b-9c79-9154b0b80805":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"2.

Aharon recommends looking straight into a mirror, whereas La Rose explains that looking slightly down into a mirror at an angle can be more comfortable for beginners. There’s no right or wrong way to look into a mirror while curling your eyelashes, though; do what feels the most comfortable for you.<br\/><br\/><\/p>"}},"743e7652-98e0-4e25-85c6-57b28cfb7d52":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"3.

Aharon recommends opting for one that is comfortable and easy to position on the eyes, has a large opening and features a squishy eyelash pad. A silicone eyelash pad that's not too soft or hard is ideal as it won't cause lash breakage and enables lashes will be curled without kinks or crimps.

Starting at the root, wiggle the mascara wand back and forth, pull up along the lashes and repeat until they’re all coated. This ensures lashes get covered from root to tip, which will help seal the curl.<\/p><p>If you’re opting for false lashes, La Rose says the reverse process is best.  Whether using a strip lash or individual lashes, apply them first and then curl afterward. Doing so allows you to clamp the false lashes with your own lashes and curl them together so they blend seamlessly. If you have extremely straight lashes, though, she recommends curling your natural lashes first, then applying the false lashes and finishing it with one more curl to blend them together. Lastly, like with all beauty tools, ensure you clean your eyelash curler regularly to remove any makeup residue and bacteria.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["b026cbe3-beba-4b2a-8caf-8b345153000e","8835bfc4-121f-46ed-aa5e-2a7c495f1cd6"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body-section-2.gif","link":"","author":"","placement":"row"}},"16620636647e5d61e7":{"type":"product-set-carousel","settings":{"title":"Shop Lifted Lash Essentials","desc":"","collection":"","dots":true,"arrows":true}},"1647275735d678f47a":{"type":"product-collection-carousel-module","blocks":{"affcb6ad-6e25-4823-8182-e6a34ecab15b":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"lash-lift-mascara"}},"39b469f2-2437-416a-8118-33ce0fea7182":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"eyelash-curler"}},"af5d40dd-e7d8-4cbb-9c54-266cdd070e21":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"minimalist-makeup-set"}}},"block_order":["affcb6ad-6e25-4823-8182-e6a34ecab15b","39b469f2-2437-416a-8118-33ce0fea7182","af5d40dd-e7d8-4cbb-9c54-266cdd070e21"],"settings":{"carousel_type":"grid_carousel","title":"","desc":"","collection":"","dots":true,"arrows":true}},"1660334548de345e46":{"type":"1col-text-dropcap","disabled":true,"settings":{"full_width":false}},"relatedstories":{"type":"article-related-stories","settings":{}}},"order":["main","163537292921f7d581","1652495422ce8dccc8","163537294920e1cd97","1664815500723fbdf0","1664815380bcb1514d","1662063635c64ac404","166481554161915652","16648157545e8359e9","16620636647e5d61e7","1647275735d678f47a","1660334548de345e46","relatedstories"]}
