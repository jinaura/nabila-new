When cell turnover is sluggish and slow, it leads to a buildup of dead skin cells which in turn can leave the skin looking dull and dry, clog pores and cause breakouts, and increase the appearance of hyperpigmentation and fine lines and wrinkles.<\/p><p>So, how can you bring back the vibrant, healthy glow of your skin?

These can be made with natural ingredients, such as sugar, salt, volcanic pumice or ground seed and nut shells. It’s always important to use a gentle scrub as harsh exfoliants can lead to micro tears in the skin. <\/p><p><strong>Chemical exfoliants<\/strong><\/p><p>Chemical exfoliants use chemical compounds, such as fruit enzymes, alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta-hydroxy acids (BHAs). Exfoliants that contain enzymes work on the surface of the skin by breaking down keratin proteins on the outermost layer of the skin. Once these protein structures have been broken down, it becomes much easier to slough off those hard to remove skin cells. If you want your exfoliant to penetrate beyond the top layer of skin, reach for an exfoliant that contains AHAs or BHAs. <\/p><p><strong>AHAs<\/strong><\/p><p>Examples are lactic and glycolic acid, which are natural, water-soluble exfoliants that penetrate deeper into the skin, removing dead skin and promoting the regeneration of new cells. While suitable for all skin types, AHAs gentler exfoliating nature means that they are often recommended for those with dryer skin in hopes of avoiding irritation. If using a body lotion or serum with exfoliating action, apply after showering or last thing at night and allow them to work while you sleep. AHAs can cause a mild tingling sensation due to their low pH, so do not apply them to freshly shaved skin.<\/p><p><strong>BHAs<\/strong><\/p><p>Like AHAs, BHAs, such as salicylic acid, are derived from natural ingredients, but are oil soluble. This means that they are able to penetrate deeper into the skin, targeting excess oil and sebum within the pores. BHAs are also antibacterial so they’re ideal for those who are prone to breakouts and acne. <\/p><p><strong>Dry brushing<\/strong><\/p><p>This is another technique that can be used for body exfoliation. This involves using a dry brush made with natural bristles to slough off dead skin. Dry brushing also helps to improve blood circulation, promote lymphatic drainage and stimulate the production of collagen and elastin. <\/p>"}},"b81368da-4ada-41a4-b953-da4b902d111c":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":false,"quotes":"“Exfoliation also improves the effects of topical serums, lotions, and moisturizers by removing dead skin cells,  and opening the pores and enhancing absorption.”","author_quotes":""}},"1659470318ac2e85cb":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"839a204d-c96e-432a-a9ef-e4f295b67b2c":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"How to exfoliate","desc":"<p>While exfoliation has multiple benefits, doing it too much can aggravate the skin and disrupt your skin's natural barrier, which may result in redness, flaking or irritation.
