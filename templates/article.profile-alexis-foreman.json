At any moment you could find her penning empowering cover stories for prestigious publications like<em> i-D <\/em>and <em>Elle<\/em>, keeping it real on her Instagram Live talk show <em>Your Favorite Auntie <\/em>or hosting a revolving door of on-camera and public speaking engagements.

And true to that path comes with setting healthy boundaries. “I now see boundaries as a super important form of self-care,” she explains. “For so long, as a Black woman occupying white spaces, I felt I had to be a certain way. Now, if I feel like I’m being taken advantage of or not getting all that I’ve worked for, I speak up about it.” Here, Carlos expands further on how her idea of self-care takes many different forms, from lighting candles to simply taking the time to listen to her favorite podcasts.
