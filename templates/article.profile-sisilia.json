My family immigrated to Los Angeles when I was a kid and I have pretty much lived all over SoCal, from Joshua Tree to Redondo Beach to South Pasadena. A few months ago I moved to New Mexico with my two kids and husband. It's been an adventure. We just had our first snowstorm since we moved here. Growing up in LA definitely has impacted my approach to beauty. LA is pretty laid back, and that's how I approach my beauty routine. I only wear makeup on shoot days which is about twice a week for me. I mainly focus on healthy nourished skin. It's always sunny in California, so I got into the routine of wearing SPF since I was in middle school. <\/p>"}},"9c87c2d3-d5ff-4364-99a8-04f03b34a50e":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>Can you recall your earliest beauty memory?<\/p>"}},"a9e30dd6-8c18-4d63-be67-079af378d66d":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"SP:","description":"<p>I remember my mom had bought Avon and the Avon lady came over to our house to personally hand-deliver the products and show my mom the skincare steps.
