At any moment you could find her penning empowering cover stories for prestigious publications like<em> i-D <\/em>and <em>Elle<\/em>, keeping it real on her Instagram Live talk show <em>Your Favorite Auntie <\/em>or hosting a revolving door of on-camera and public speaking engagements. The kicker? No matter the agenda item, you can expect Carlos to do it in a stunning sartorial look. While living and working stylishly is definitely a calling card for this former <em>Vogue<\/em> editor, making time for self-care has also become non-negotiable for showing up as her best self every day. “For me, self-care is a way of saying to myself, ‘You deserve more and that’s okay,’” she tells Rose Inc. “It’s my way of telling myself that I don’t always have to be on and producing something—that I deserve [rest].”<\/p><p>All in all, Carlos feels her best when she’s following her own path, no matter what. “It’s a very visceral experience,” she shares. And true to that path comes with setting healthy boundaries. “I now see boundaries as a super important form of self-care,” she explains. “For so long, as a Black woman occupying white spaces, I felt I had to be a certain way. Now, if I feel like I’m being taken advantage of or not getting all that I’ve worked for, I speak up about it.” Here, Carlos expands further on how her idea of self-care takes many different forms, from lighting candles to simply taking the time to listen to her favorite podcasts.
