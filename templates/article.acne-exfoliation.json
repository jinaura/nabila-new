Here’s why: “The issue with excess oil is that it causes the top layer of the skin cells to stick together,” she says, adding that this can clog pores and lead to cystic acne and acne scarring. “Beta-hydroxy acids such as salicylic acid are great at dissolving the oil between the skin cells.” <br\/><br\/><strong>Gentle Physical Exfoliators<br\/><br\/><\/strong>Physical exfoliators, such as jojoba beads, can also help reduce oil production and the clumping of dead skills in oily and acne-prone skin, in turn helping prevent breakouts, Dr. Mack says.

This, she says, “prevents excessive oil from causing the top layer of skin cells — or epidermis — from sticking together, clogging the pores, and leading to cystic acne and acne scarring.”<br\/><br\/>For oily skin, Dr. Mack prescribes exfoliating up to three times per week. If your skin is oily <em>and <\/em>acne-prone, she suggests upping it to four times per week. And, if your skin responds well to the exfoliation, meaning there’s no sign of irritation, Dr. Mehr says it’s safe to exfoliate as often as once to twice daily. However, if you’re new to exfoliation, remember to start off slow and increase the frequency gradually as your skin tolerates it. <\/p><p><\/p><p>Signs that you may be over-exfoliating, Dr. Mack and Dr. Mehr say include having pink, dry, tight, or irritated skin or even eczema-like rashes. If you’re not exfoliating enough, Dr. Mehr says your skin may appear dull and clogged, so upping the frequency of exfoliation is a good idea.<br\/><br\/>As for where exfoliation fits into your skincare routine, Dr. Mack recommends cleansing your skin first to remove all the debris, makeup, and oil, which then allows the exfoliator to more effectively remove the dead skin cells. Then, Dr. Mehr says you can apply your topicals like serums and creams which can better penetrate the skin once the dead skin is out of the way. <\/p>"}},"164636248329799ad7":{"type":"product-collection-carousel-module","blocks":{"e292d3d8-c0aa-4087-906b-5076aa29397b":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"skin-clarity-gentle-exfoliating-cleanser"}},"d7258c32-a3df-46ce-b553-29f7d2dc1862":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"reusable-makeup-pad-10-count"}},"0d471e3e-a528-4e0d-83fe-03c8f3e45632":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"clarifying-toner"}}},"block_order":["e292d3d8-c0aa-4087-906b-5076aa29397b","d7258c32-a3df-46ce-b553-29f7d2dc1862","0d471e3e-a528-4e0d-83fe-03c8f3e45632"],"settings":{"carousel_type":"grid_carousel","title":"","desc":"","collection":"","dots":true,"arrows":true}},"1646181998f61e25d7":{"type":"1col-image-video","disabled":true,"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/model-cleanser-3-2000x2000.jpg","link":"","video_url":"","custom_video_url":"","author":""}},"1646362489a2e7621e":{"type":"1col-text-center","disabled":true,"settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"","text_center":"<p>Signs that you may be over-exfoliating, Dr. Mack and Dr. Mehr say include having pink, dry, tight, or irritated skin or even eczema-like rashes.
