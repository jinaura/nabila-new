But I remember when I graduated, I was working with a magazine. I went to interview a renowned photographer friend of mine. And I remember him saying to me, ‘Chelsea, you need to put on makeup. You can't be walking around like this. You're beautiful, but you need to put on makeup.’ I remember going through my mom's makeup bag trying to figure out my foundation shade. But again, my mom's lighter than me. Once I moved to the States, I started going to the MAC beauty counter because they were the only ones that carried darker shades at the time. I remember going on YouTube and trying to follow tutorials as well.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["f83227d2-94bc-4bfd-b486-65f3acb32111","ea5710ea-cea4-4362-b014-9d6a5eaa143a","fafeeda8-f8b1-43e1-81fa-5b074edac818","72eb0234-5805-4c75-8bd8-0548d5fdad14"],"disabled":true,"settings":{"full_width":false}},"1664815500723fbdf0":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":true,"quotes":"\"...mixing and matching is key to my style and how I balance everything out...\"","author_quotes":""}},"1664815380bcb1514d":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"b8742bca-a14c-4529-b3d8-57fc4f2b58ea":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"RI:","description":"<p>Which SS23 shows have been your favorites so far?<\/p>"}},"eac73995-c308-42b8-9248-8ed8421714dc":{"type":"dropcap","settings":{"dropcap":"ES:","description":"<p>Loewe this morning was great.

We try to make sure we have moments together outside of fashion week, like a great dinner or something. <br\/><br\/>It’s always important for me at night to have a routine and wash my face. In the mornings before shows, I always start with my makeup and hair and literally get dressed 5 minutes before I have to leave. It’s always so busy!<br\/><br\/>Music is also really important to me throughout fashion week. The Madonna and Beyoncé “Break My Soul” remix has been on repeat at the moment. It’s a great track for getting in the right mood when getting myself ready to go out at night during fashion week. I love listening to Megan Thee Stallion in the car between shows. Mariah Carey is also a great mood booster on gray Paris days. I’m really into Janet at the moment, and “Together Again” is the perfect song for this season because we’re all finally back together at fashion week again.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["47e093a5-7320-4946-b446-4acb816337a3","5012f4bd-3410-4d18-86b5-902717f0b4bd"],"settings":{"full_width":false}},"1664835141f484c729":{"type":"1col-image-video","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/22_PFW_Editorial_Emili_Sindlev_Lena_Herrmann_04.jpg","link":"","video_url":"","custom_video_url":"","author":"Lena Herrmann"}},"166483068091cec891":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"Get Ready for PFW With Emili Sindlev's go-to playlist","text_center":""}},"1664830494f0c0525d":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":false,"quotes":"<iframe style=\"border-radius:12px\" src=\"https:\/\/open.spotify.com\/embed\/playlist\/1yTDflMfqxZv7hY9hFjrR0?utm_source=generator\" width=\"100%\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" allow=\"autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" loading=\"lazy\"><\/iframe>","author_quotes":""}},"1664830757f64c747b":{"type":"product-set-carousel","settings":{"title":"Shop Emili’s Fashion Week Look ","desc":"","collection":"","dots":true,"arrows":true}},"1647275735d678f47a":{"type":"product-collection-carousel-module","blocks":{"affcb6ad-6e25-4823-8182-e6a34ecab15b":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"satin-shimmer-duet-eyeshadow"}},"af5d40dd-e7d8-4cbb-9c54-266cdd070e21":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"lash-lift-mascara"}},"39b469f2-2437-416a-8118-33ce0fea7182":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"eyelash-curler"}},"56a63dd0-481f-4e4f-baf4-2378d422ebdb":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"skin-enhance-luminous-tinted-serum"}},"af3eecef-81c9-4021-acc5-009027b9e70a":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"cream-blush-refillable-cheek-lip-color-refill"}},"4a45259f-bc0c-4ba9-86ad-549f968783b9":{"type":"product","settings":{"product":"satin-lip-color-rich-refillable-lipstick"}}},"block_order":["affcb6ad-6e25-4823-8182-e6a34ecab15b","af5d40dd-e7d8-4cbb-9c54-266cdd070e21","39b469f2-2437-416a-8118-33ce0fea7182","56a63dd0-481f-4e4f-baf4-2378d422ebdb","af3eecef-81c9-4021-acc5-009027b9e70a","4a45259f-bc0c-4ba9-86ad-549f968783b9"],"settings":{"carousel_type":"grid_carousel","title":"","desc":"","collection":"","dots":true,"arrows":true}},"1660334548de345e46":{"type":"1col-text-dropcap","disabled":true,"settings":{"full_width":false}},"relatedstories":{"type":"article-related-stories","settings":{}},"1664829914487c4d36":{"type":"text-image-carousel-module","settings":{"carousel_type":"grid_carousel","title":"Heading","desc":"<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
