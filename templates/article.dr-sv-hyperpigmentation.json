Hyperpigmentation, for example, can be caused when melanin remains at the skin’s surface after being exposed to the sun, causing an unevenness in tone, she explains. “People [with medium, deep, and dark complexions] are more predisposed to hyperpigmentation because their melanin structures are larger, and more active, so they’re easier to trigger by sunlight, UV irradiation, or inflammation.”<\/p><p>Melasma is another common type. “The major difference between hyperpigmentation and melasma is that the latter has a hormonal onset,” Dr. Vali adds. “It’s more common in women because it has been linked to estrogen, and it's usually diagnosed by its symmetrical pattern.” This isn’t to say anyone needs to have perfectly-even skin, but for those who are looking to correct or slow discoloration that’s been bothering them, Dr. Vali breaks down her recommended protocol, below.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["839e3029-b434-4b59-9f68-28b457cd4f25"],"settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/body_1_397ff714-21f0-4805-9d89-8f99006fa381.webp","link":"","author":"","placement":"row"}},"16593881130899e609":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"ONCE-DAILY SPF ISN'T ENOUGH","text_center":"<p>“Regardless of your complexion, you need protection against all the factors that cause or worsen pigmentary disorders,” Dr. Vali says. “Even throughout winter, because of the low air quality and insane exposure to blue light that jeopardize the skin's barrier, you should always wear at least SPF 15.” Reapplication is essential: “UV filters and antioxidants are depleted during the protection process… You have to be consistent.” Dr. Vali recommends reapplying sunscreen with a chemical filter (since it works well on all skin tones) several times per day when avoiding the sun isn’t practical.<\/p>"}},"1659388119fc1d465b":{"type":"1col-text-center","settings":{"full_width":false,"title":"ADD KEY INGREDIENTS","text_center":"<p>“My first-line recommendation for all dermal discoloration is topical skincare,” Dr. Vali says. “There are a number of ingredients to look out for in your cosmeceuticals to help reduce your skin condition at home.
