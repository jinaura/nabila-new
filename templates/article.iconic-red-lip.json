Wine. Ruby. Every shade of red coveys something slightly different—especially when punctuating the mouth. Westman called upon the eternally-classic, slightly-retro shade of tomato to launch her residency. In a dreamy matte finish, it carries the ultimate allure of a bygone era.<br\/><br\/>“I always think of Marilyn Monroe or Grace Kelly when I picture a tomato red lip,” Westman says. But channelling the golden age of Hollywood in 2020 requires more than old photographs. “The look has to be groomed, polished, and all about the lip,” she says. To keep things modern, Westman grounded the vibrant shade with soft brows, dewy skin, and, while it might seem counterintuitive, lashes free from mascara. The result is a nod to the past, made for today.<\/p>"}},"1664896381f2f2a5f7":{"type":"1col-image-video","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Iconic_Red_Lip_3.webp","link":"","video_url":"","custom_video_url":"","author":""}},"166490058928056974":{"type":"1col-quote","settings":{"full_width":true,"quotes":"‘‘ I ALWAYS THINK OF MARILYN MONROE OR GRACE KELLY WHEN I PICTURE A TOMATO RED LIP  ’’","author_quotes":""}},"a3341c77-2e22-49ca-b5ea-bb6a17596740":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"bcbc31ec-e3c9-4262-b07e-4c9b7564dd90":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"BEHIND THIS LOOK:","desc":"<p>Using only whisper-thin layers of makeup was important for maintaining the chic, fresh look seen here, so Westman started with a tried-and-true pro trick: Two shades of foundation instead of concealer, foundation, and contour.<\/p><p><br\/>She started by patting Westman Atelier’s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.westman-atelier.com\/products\/vital-skin?variant=30144847511595\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Vital Skin Foundation Stick<\/strong><\/a> in XI only where Tsheca needed coverage—a technique the artist calls “patching”—then added seamless contour by using a second, darker shade of the same foundation stick (XII). “I always use two shades of foundation,” Westman says, noting that it’s easiest to apply both before gently buffing them together with a single foundation brush.
