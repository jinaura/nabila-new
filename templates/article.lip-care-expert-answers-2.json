While many lip balms might temporarily soothe irritated lips, they often contain flavors, fragrance and preservatives that may dry out lips in the long run and cause further irritation. “I personally like to stay away from any lip balms containing parabens, phthalates, alcohol, butylated hydroxytoluene, mineral oil and PEG-8,” says cosmetologist and medical esthetician Gentry. Instead, look for ingredients that hydrate, moisturize and work as a barrier to prevent water loss.<\/p><p><br\/><\/p>"}},"bc885b16-9131-446a-8bbc-98999e17ce7d":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Do you need to put sunscreen on your lips?","desc":"<p>“Absolutely,” says Scott, a licensed esthetician who has spent years working alongside dermatologists. “The delicate skin on the lips burns very easily. UV exposure is also the main cause of premature aging. It's easier to protect and prevent this damage than it is to correct it.” Scott recommends extending your facial sun protectant onto your lips saying, “I use the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/products\/solar-power-luminous-spf-30-serum\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Solar Power Luminous SPF 30 Serum<\/span><\/a> on my full face and across my lips.

Apply lip balm about ten minutes prior to applying lipstick, then start your skincare routine or make up application. This will give your lip treatment time to work. Reapplying lipstick can also cause lips to look cracked, so clean off your lipstick and start afresh.
