Nicknamed “Hollywood’s green makeup artist,” she’s cultivated a loyal following—Olivia Wilde, January Jones, and Olivia Munn are just a few of her A-list clients—for both her artistry and love of natural products and holistic treatments. “You never know what's going to happen on the road with a client,” Denno says. “I've whipped up a lot of solutions at the 11th hour on a press junket, from cold spoons on the eyes to a yogurt mask.”<br\/><br\/>This month, Rose Inc. has tapped Denno for something special: A mini series of four at-home beauty treatments. By utilizing natural fruit enzymes for exfoliation, the antibacterial properties of honey and apple cider vinegar, and more ingredient superfoods you probably already have on hand, she created easy weekly indulgences to keep our faces and scalps healthy while self-isolating—and yes, they’re great for making memories with family, too.<\/p>"}},"a3341c77-2e22-49ca-b5ea-bb6a17596740":{"type":"2col-text-image","blocks":{"edcdac87-e97e-431d-b000-43282c5c3406":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"HER DIY INSPIRATION:","desc":"<p>Perhaps the easiest and most common beauty DIY around, creating a skin-smoothing scrub requires only carrier oil and granulated sugar, but can be elevated with a few drops of essential oil. “You can also use fine salt if you prefer,” Denno says, but notes that since sugar is a humectant, the hydrating benefits make it the better choice.<\/p><p>What’s more, it saves: “Fill a jar in your bathroom with your scrub to exfoliate on repeat,” Denno says.
