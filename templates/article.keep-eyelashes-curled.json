Lash curlers made of plastic and ones that have sharp edges should be avoided, says Gabbay, noting that stainless steel versions (another feature of Rose Inc’s design) are a better option. Also, consider the quality of the eye pad in the lash curler. \"Make sure the pad inserted into the metal curler is squishy enough to lift and bend; silicone is best,\" Aharon says. \"If it's too soft or too hard, you run the risk of lash breakage.\" <br\/><br\/><\/p>"}},"b4b67188-e756-4152-a804-aab7553c879f":{"type":"text","settings":{"title":"Take your time","desc":"<p>A mistake La Rose sees people make often is not squeezing the lash curler long enough, which creates an awkward crimp rather than a curl.
