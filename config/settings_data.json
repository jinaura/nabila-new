As the eye mask calms swollen or itchy skin under the eyes, Marí suggests using her self-massage technique to further reduce bloat and begin to drain the lymph: Anchor index fingers near the center of the forehead at the hairline, then use thumbs to apply light pressure while tracing the arch of the brow, above bone, starting at the inner corners and ending at the temples. Repeat a few times.\nThe esthetician says this protocol can take an indulgent 10 minutes or more to complete—or whatever time you can spare. “Just a few movements around the eye area will really help to push that lymph through for increased circulation and decreased puffiness,” she says, adding the process may also help ease sinus pressure and calm irritation."}},"4c4cf10d-a91a-4089-bf7e-c2dba06c0b8c":{"type":"slide","settings":{"text-wh-image-article":"news\/test-blog-post","heading":"sggsdgsdfgsd","description":"fgsdfgsdfgsdfg"}}},"block_order":["c2a73ebb-19f6-4796-bbe1-ba3f3997a2f1","4c4cf10d-a91a-4089-bf7e-c2dba06c0b8c"],"settings":{}},"1X-text-wh-center":{"type":"1X-text-wh-center","settings":{}},"2X-image-text-wh":{"type":"2X-image-text-wh","settings":{}},"2X-text-wh-product":{"type":"2X-text-wh-product","settings":{}},"2X-image-text-wh-2":{"type":"2X-image-text-wh-2","settings":{}},"1X-quote-center2":{"type":"1X-quote-center2","settings":{}},"1X-text-wh-center2":{"type":"1X-text-wh-center2","settings":{}},"2X-text-wh-image-2":{"type":"2X-text-wh-image-2","settings":{}},"2X-collection-text-wh":{"type":"2X-collection-text-wh","settings":{}},"all-article-modules":{"type":"all-article-modules","blocks":{"6e9720ce-18e2-4c25-8972-30be00322473":{"type":"2col-text-image","settings":{"article":"news\/test-blog-post","left_dropcap_1":"ad","left_dropcap_description_1":"adsad","left_dropcap_2":"","left_dropcap_description_2":"","left_dropcap_3":"","left_dropcap_description_3":"","left_dropcap_4":"","left_dropcap_description_4":"","left_dropcap_5":"","left_dropcap_description_5":"","link":""}},"100dbc47-4ee2-432d-ba4f-69290cb38d51":{"type":"2col-text-image","settings":{"article":"news\/test-blog-post","left_dropcap_1":"","left_dropcap_description_1":"Amin","left_dropcap_2":"","left_dropcap_description_2":"","left_dropcap_3":"","left_dropcap_description_3":"","left_dropcap_4":"","left_dropcap_description_4":"","left_dropcap_5":"","left_dropcap_description_5":"","link":""}},"652f3c82-e35b-4b79-9757-45b1111bca50":{"type":"1-col-text-center","settings":{"text-center-article":"profile\/actress-courtney-halverson-shares-makeup-chair-secrets","text_center":"When asked for tips and tricks from the professional makeup chair, actress <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/prettylittlefawn\/?hl=en\">\nCourtney Halverson<\/a><\/b> first sets the stage. “I’ve worked on a lot of horror films and thrillers, so oftentimes the makeup my characters’ wear is either minimal...or else a bit gory,” she explains. “So I may not be the best person to ask!” Still, her professional range — she’s also a <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/prettylittlefawn\/?hl=en\">blogger with a cinema-inspired eye<\/a><\/b> — provides a wealth of beauty knowledge. “On the rare occasion I get to play a character who looks their best, I always ask a lot of questions in the makeup chair,” she says.

Oils have always been key for me, I really don’t use many creams, so I started focusing on taking time to apply face oils and use that as an opportunity for a facial massage, both in the evening and in the morning. I’m finding even now that I don’t use makeup in the same way; it’s something that is fun and I like for enhancement, but it doesn’t feel as needed now that my skin is happier.\n\nBi-weekly masking also became an easy thing for me to do while answering emails and editing photos, as well as taking a long bath and really moisturizing my body afterwards.

Here are Le's top tips for strong, healthy nails.\n<br>\n<br>\n1. \"Healthy nails start from within,\" says Amy, recommending that those who are able to add a biotin supplement to their wellness routine, should. \n<br>\n<br>\n2. Cuticle oil and hand cream are an absolute must. \"Especially right now, with all the excessive hand sanitizer and hand washing, your nails and hands are getting dried out due to the high alcohol levels,\" she says. \"If your hands aren't properly moisturized, you will notice your nails are more prone to chipping and breaking, and hangnails will occur more often.\" \n<br>\n<br>\nHer favorite scented cuticle oil is <b><a href=\"https:\/\/myshlf.us\/p-138921\">Essie Apricot Cuticle Oil<\/a><\/b> and her favorite unscented cuticle oil is <b><a href=\"https:\/\/myshlf.us\/p-138922\">CND Solar Oil<\/a><\/b>, which contains jojoba oil and mimics the oils found on your skin, so it absorbs quickly. She's partial to the <b><a href=\"https:\/\/myshlf.us\/p-138923\">Summer Fridays Jet Lag Mask<\/a><\/b> for her hand cream. \"I cannot sleep without it,\" Amy raves. \"It's the last step of my night routine — I massage it all over my face and use the excess for my hands before bed. I wake up with baby hands every time!\" \n<br>\n<br>\n3. The less your nails are in water, the better. \"I'm sure you notice that soft and bendy feel after you finish a sink full of dishes or after a long bubble bath,” Le says. “Your nail bed is like a sponge. [They’re] porous and absorb water, which weakens your nails.” She recommends opting for gloves when cleaning or doing the dishes and avoid soaking your nails at the salon, which will help to keep your paint job fresher, longer.\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>Photographed by Amy Le.<\/i>"}},"82160648-0093-4982-b074-8a5c42ae1cc6":{"type":"1-col-text-center","settings":{"text-center-article":"education\/rose-inc-hyaluronic-acid-skincare-experts","text_center":"In the world of skincare, “it” ingredients seem to come and go. This oversaturated reality causes many of us to feel overwhelmed when it comes to figuring out what products to try. But if there’s a staple you should include in your routine, it’s likely hyaluronic acid. \n<br>\n<br>\n“It’s an important hydrating compound made up of sugars and is both naturally-occurring and found in the human body,” says board-certified dermatologist Caroline Robinson MD, FAAD. “It powerfully attracts moisture throughout the deeper layers of the skin and in other areas of the body such as our joints.” \n<br>\n<br>\nIn addition to it being a powerful hydrator, it’s also important to note that hyaluronic acid comes in many different “molecular weights,” each having different functions, says Jessica Kizovski, the product development manager at Rose Inc. “Larger forms of HA help to hydrate the top layers of the skin,” she says, adding that larger molecules create a protective barrier across the skin. “Smaller forms are able to penetrate slightly deeper and hydrate the skin from within,” she adds. “In general, the larger the molecule, the harder it is to penetrate the skin.” That means not all HA is created equal. \n<br>\n<br>\nTo help you figure out which hyaluronic acid is right for you, top experts weigh in on what the ultra-hydrating ingredient is, why it’s important to use, and when it is most recommended to use it, ahead."}},"c2c895e9-32af-4768-ba1b-488506445481":{"type":"2-col-image-text-wh","settings":{"image-text-wh-article":"education\/rose-inc-hyaluronic-acid-skincare-experts","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/mathilde-langevin-FDRaYqiTY1k-unsplash_a5f0c310-28d4-4129-9c96-72bd24c5c7bb.jpg","link":"","image_title":"","heading":"","description":"<b>What is hyaluronic acid?<\/b>\n<br>\n<br>\n“HA is considered a humectant, which is a hydrating molecule that attracts water to the skin,” says Samantha Mims, aesthetician and founder of Dermasaa. Dr. Robinson adds that, “In our skin, it powerfully attracts moisture throughout the deeper layers and in other areas of the body.” This includes joints, where it acts to lubricate and cushion the body. “In dermatology, we also use injectable hyaluronic acid gels as an injectable filler to hydrate or re-volumize areas of loss.”\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>\nWhat are the benefits of HA??\n<\/b>\n<br>\n<br>\nGiven that it’s so hydrating, hyaluronic acid is most beneficial to use for those with drier skin types. “It moisturizes and attracts more moisture to the skin at the same time,” Dr. Robinson says, nothing that it’s also safe for all skin types. Mims recommends HA for mature skin, too. “It’ll build skin collagen and reduce the signs of premature aging,” she says. For example, those who experience fine lines, “Hyaluronic acid can help to hydrate them, making lines look less apparent,” Dr. Robinson says.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>\nWhen is the best time to use HA?\n<\/b>\n<br>\n<br>\nWith the popularization of multistep-routines, determining what order to use which product and ingredient can feel intimidating. Mims suggests thinking of HA as a pre-moisturizer. In terms of timing and frequency, Mims says this: I believe in moderate use. Every other day or just a few times out of the week is enough.”\n<br>\n<br>\nDr. Robinson also agrees that too much of a good thing can sometimes have negative effects on the skin. “Many products, including moisturizers, now incorporate hyaluronic acid into their formulas,” she says. “This means that sometimes we are doubling and tripling up on this active ingredient in our skin care routines.”. In other words, always check the ingredients on all of the products in your routine. “Using too much hyaluronic acid can have the opposite of the intended effect on the skin and actually dry the skin out,” the docto adds.I recommend sticking to once or twice daily use in no more than one step in your routine, morning and night.”"}},"8ad18002-3b91-4f73-9182-9848fe12da9c":{"type":"1-col-quote-center","settings":{"quote-center-article":"education\/rose-inc-hyaluronic-acid-skincare-experts","quotes":"“HA is considered a humectant, which is a hydrating molecule that attracts water to the skin”","author_quotes":""}},"184bfe4c-7575-4979-8ce2-5961593595bc":{"type":"2-col-text-wh-image","settings":{"text-wh-image-article":"education\/rose-inc-hyaluronic-acid-skincare-experts","heading":"","description":"<b>What are the different types of HA?<\/b>\n<br>\n<br>\nA common form is hydrolyzed hyaluronic acid. “This form of hyaluronic acid undergoes a slight chemical modification where the molecule is essentially ‘cut up’ into smaller pieces,” says Rose Inc’s KizovskiThis modification allows for the new, smaller versions to penetrate the skin deeper than virgin HA, while still focusing on surface level hydration.”.\n<br>\n<br>\nSodium hyaluronate, the sodium salt of hyaluronic acid, is another form. “This version is known to penetrate the furthest into the skin due to its small size,” Kizovski adds.“This form of HA is small enough to penetrate through your pores and is known for prolonged stability within cosmetic formulations, making it extremely popular within the skincare world.”.\n<br>\n<br>\nIt is also important to note that HA can have different origins: from animal sources or, even created synthetically through bacterial fermentation.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>How to apply HA<\/b>\n<br>\n<br>\n“The skin always better absorbs HA when it's applied directly onto damp skin,” Mims shares, reminding us that all products actually penetrate best when the skin is damp. “The best way to use HA is while the skin is clean and before your moisturizer.” Dr. Robinson adds. “[Applying it to damp skin]can help pull the moisture from the water on your skin into the skin as opposed to the other way around.”","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/pexels-sora-shimazaki-5938590.jpg","link":"","image_title":""}},"82647d06-c3dc-4614-87fe-19007e93a61f":{"type":"1-col-quote-center","settings":{"quote-center-article":"education\/rose-inc-hyaluronic-acid-skincare-experts","quotes":"Shop our favorite hydrating skincare and makeup","author_quotes":""}},"438fcda2-5cc1-4b0e-b0d8-ca1955e8f0fe":{"type":"2-col-text-wh-product","settings":{"text-wh-product-article":"education\/rose-inc-hyaluronic-acid-skincare-experts","heading":"","description":"This all-in-one primer, serum, and moisturizer ticks all the boxes with its potent blend of squalane, sodium hyaluronate, and sea fennel extract.

Nicknamed the “feathered brow,” her in-salon bootcamp takes thin arches (often belonging to the rich and famous) to their full potential thanks to a prescriptive protocol that includes tinting, shaping, and styling—all of which come only after her required grow-out period.\n<br>\n<br>\n“The best way to take your brows into your own hands is to first let them grow completely untouched for six to eight weeks,” the in-demand expert says, noting that only after this can the real work begin. “This means absolutely no tweezing, threading, or trimming of any kind.”\n<br>\n<br>\nWhile this first step is undoubtedly daunting, there’s a method to her madness: Removing even a few stray hairs disturbs the hair growth cycle, so taking a hands-off approach allows dormant follicles to produce hairs you never knew you had. With social distancing mandates still in effect across many parts of the country, there’s never been a better time to take on the challenge. In fact, you may have already done this without even realizing it, which is why we tapped Streicher for a pro guide to not only growing out your brows, but grooming them with restraint once they’ve filled in.

Trim hairs one at a time, staggering the lengths for a more natural look. Do not cut the hairs straight across or all at once.” Once the length of your hairs is adjusted, create a “buffer zone” for tweezing with a brow pencil. “Simply draw a line around your entire brow,” she says, noting that this ‘no-tweeze zone’ should be about the size of the tip of a cotton swab, or approximately half a centimeter. “Tweeze only the hairs that fall outside of this!”\n<br>\n<br>\nFor those who need additional guidance, consider Streicher’s <b><a href=\"https:\/\/featheredbrow.com\/virtual-appointments.php\">virtual appointment<\/a><\/b> offerings. “With these appointments you will receive detailed eyebrow tweezing and trimming instructions, custom guided grooming tips, and instructions on how to properly fill in your eyebrows,” she says."}},"987d56cf-0959-430b-91c0-ea48d7f1ef81":{"type":"2-col-text-wh-product","settings":{"text-wh-product-article":"education\/kristie-streicher-s-3-step-protocol-for-fuller-brows","heading":"STEP 3: STYLE","description":"The brushed-up brow aesthetic is not only popular among Streciher’s clients—like Mandy Moore, Adele, and Sarah Paulson—it’s universally flattering and can be accomplished with just a tinted brow gel.

But Harvey says pushing it too far ultimately does more harm than good. “Cleaning the scalp is <i>so<\/i> important and perhaps my number one tip for all hair types, but especially for those with curly hair,” she explains. “You should be cleansing your scalp every 7 to 10 days to remove any product build-up, sweat, or impurities.” Harvey walks the walk, too, revealing that she prioritizes scalp care in her own routine. “When it comes to my own hair, scalp care is king. On wash days, my priority is making sure that I treat my scalp with non-abrasive scrubs and scalp treatments that contain exfoliating ingredients,” she adds."}},"7e99825a-10b4-4ff3-a103-1d07e860f0c7":{"type":"1-col-quote-center","settings":{"quote-center-article":"education\/curly-natural-hair-texture-tips","quotes":"“Frizz is natural, and edges are beautiful—they don’t always need to be tamed…”","author_quotes":""}},"cb0d356c-a2a6-4f82-8800-dd7e7f83bd06":{"type":"2-col-image-text-wh","settings":{"image-text-wh-article":"education\/curly-natural-hair-texture-tips","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screen_Shot_2021-09-17_at_12.54.42_PM.jpg","link":"","image_title":"","heading":"MAINTAIN MOISTURE","description":"Since the twists and turns of coily, curly, and wavy hair strands make it harder for natural oils from the scalp to travel down each shaft, these textures often require added moisture to maintain the coveted shape and shine indicative of healthy hair. “Regardless of how your hair is styled or the type of curls that you have, you should be adding moisture and hydration daily. It’s like drinking a glass of water for your hair—the ultimate hydration,” Harvey says. \n<br>\n<br>\nBut moisture replenishment extends beyond daily styling; wash day is also an excellent time to make sure your tresses are adequately quenched. To this end, Harvey suggests opting for mild shampoos that won’t leave the hair and scalp totally stripped or overly dry as your most-used cleansing agent. “I don’t use shampoo every single wash. As its sole purpose is to strip away dirt and oil, it can leave the scalp and hair super cleansed but also vulnerable to dryness if not treated correctly,” she explains. “I say investing in a scalp product is highly beneficial, alongside a great hair mask, leave-in conditioner, and light daily moisturizer.”"}},"64c752c0-85fb-4cfe-806f-a258880ccfd0":{"type":"1-col-text-wh-center","settings":{"text-wh-center-article":"education\/curly-natural-hair-texture-tips","heading":"STICK TO WHAT WORKS FOR YOU","description":"“Whilst the natural hair community are true innovators and have influenced an entire movement within the industry, there is also a lot of confusion as to the dos and don’ts for natural hair,” Harvey shares. “So many good and functional ingredients have been blacklisted, but I say work with ingredients that work with your hair as opposed to what’s trending,” she emphasizes. “Your routine and styling is all about a balance. Take using heat for example. You can use heat, but not excessively and on a lower setting that doesn’t destroy the bonds or lead to mechanical damage when implementing styling practices,” she advises."}},"1ecc8fa8-58d1-435f-94bb-bc648516871d":{"type":"1-col-text-wh-center","settings":{"text-wh-center-article":"education\/curly-natural-hair-texture-tips","heading":"DO LESS","description":"Too much of just about anything tends to have less than favorable consequences and according to Harvey, this goes for over-manipulating your hair with daily styling or protective styles that place undue stress on it. “Give your hair a break in between,” she urges. “With the tension caused by consistent cornrows or the same parting manipulated repeatedly, it can cause damage. Imagine walking on a path in the grass continuously.

Contouring—a method of dramatically defining facial features by placing complexion shades lighter and darker than the skin in the hollows and on the high points of the face—has maintained massive popularity among the Instagram and YouTube communities for years. But according to renowned celebrity makeup artist Tasha Reiko Brown, there’s a way to accentuate our natural features and achieve the perfect amount of definition without layering tons of product or spending tons of time. It’s called soft sculpting, and Brown thinks it’s a game changer for everyday makeup.\n<br>\n<br>\n“When you sculpt the face, you bring out the natural highlights and shadows. It’s the perfect backdrop for an enhanced lift,” she explains. “Soft sculpting is more refined and more elegant than the harsher contouring we have been used to. It’s about diffusion and softly carving out the architecture of the face.” With over two decades of industry experience and a client list packed with heavy hitters from Tracee Ellis Ross to Gabrielle Union, Lil Nas X and Alicia Keys, Brown knows a thing or two about customizing makeup to serve the individual. “It’s about working with the lovely and unique features we individually have. We run into issues with makeup when we try and sculpt something that isn’t there,” she says. Here, Brown lays out her soft sculpting protocol."}},"1f653dd9-a65e-4384-9e46-ab6ad5572fe1":{"type":"2-col-image-text-wh","settings":{"image-text-wh-article":"education\/soft-sculpting-natural-contour-guide","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Photo_Aug_15_6_13_46_PM.jpg","link":"","image_title":"","heading":"CONSIDER YOUR CANVAS","description":"First things first: skin. “It’s really important to understand your skin and don’t play with it too much,” Brown emphasizes. “It’s all about working with the skin as opposed to making your skin work with the product.” If you have an oily complexion, Brown recommends reaching for mattifying base products to give your makeup lasting power. She says this is far superior to the alternative of having to correct oiliness at the end, which could lead to piling on too much makeup.\n<br>\n<br>\n“When it comes to soft sculpting, I always aim for the skin to appear satin in texture and you can create that by only applying the foundation where you need it. That tends to be the t-zone and the center of the face,” Brown outlines. To finish, she says a light dusting of loose powder offers the most natural-looking blurring effect while slightly toning down any excess shine."}},"cddda530-5376-4409-be2d-f8e622054c2e":{"type":"1-col-text-wh-center","settings":{"text-wh-center-article":"education\/soft-sculpting-natural-contour-guide","heading":"NOTE YOUR UNDERTONE","description":"For your best results with soft sculpting, Brown says you’ve got to get your hands on bronzers and blushes that complement your skin tone. “I often find those with paler skin tones will work with a bronzer that is too orange or too red and in the same breath, deeper skin tones working with a bronzer that is too cold or too neutral.

It adds a depth to the skin that defines the soft sculpt. Don’t go in too hard too quickly,” Brown instructs. “For highlight, you want to elicit a natural glow, so I like to mix a little liquid highlight into the foundation and then press into the face.

In reality, though, there aren’t many ingredients that truly do it all. Vitamin E is one of the few that can. One reason might be it’s complex composition. According to Rose Inc product development manager Jessica Kizovsk, Vitamin E is actually a collection of eight different compounds that work together to create a potent antioxidant. As such, it's able to fight free radical damage and protect the skin against UV rays, pollution and general stress.\n<br>\n<br>\nVitamin E is widely known as an all-over remedy to be used on both the face and body, but dermatologist <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/laurascottandco\/?hl=en\"> Laura Scott<\/a> <\/b>, MD, associate director skin of color for the Dr. Phillip Frost department of dermatology at the Miller School of Medicine advises exercising caution. “[Be] careful with formulation, as a product formulated for the body should not be used for the face,” she says, adding that products formulated for the body can be too heavy for the face and lead to breakouts. Meanwhile, NYC-based esthetician <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/seangarrette\/?hl=en\"> Sean Garrette<\/a> <\/b> recommends seeking out vitamin E used in tandem with other <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.roseinc.com\/blogs\/education\/how-to-layer-skin-care-products\">skincare actives<\/a> <\/b>. “Look for vitamin C serums that include vitamin E in its formula,” he gives as an example. “It adds to its free radical fighting abilities and helps stabilize L-Ascorbic Acid based serums.” Genius.\n<br>\n<br>\nBelow our experts shed light on all things vitamin E, explaining what it is, its benefits and how often to use it."}},"32dd1296-3c38-4e53-83df-ba8c8a7efaea":{"type":"1-col-text-wh-center","settings":{"text-wh-center-article":"education\/vitamin-e-in-skincare","heading":"What is vitamin E?","description":"When it comes to vitamins, there are two classifications that determine how molecules can move within and get stored in the skin: water-soluble or fat-soluble. “Vitamin E is a group of fat-soluble antioxidants,” Scott explains. Among other things, this means it has the potential to be stored within the skin cells longer before needing replenishment than a water-soluble vitamin. “[Vitamin E is] essential to cell function and skin health,” Garrette adds. “It has anti-inflammatory properties and can help reduce UV-induced skin damage from free radicals.” Further, Scott notes that vitamin E can vary. “There are actually at least eight different forms of vitamin E in nature,” she says. “The one we use on our body is called alpha-tocopherol.”"}},"9f939527-d6f3-41ce-be0f-d410eec6e8b8":{"type":"2-col-image-text-wh","settings":{"image-text-wh-article":"education\/vitamin-e-in-skincare","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Rose-Inc-Ingredient-Vitamin-E-2.jpg","link":"","image_title":"","heading":"What are the benefits of vitamin E?","description":"“In the skin, free radicals can contribute to premature aging and collagen breakdown, hyperpigmentation and more.

Additionally, as Garrette calls out, vitamin E can calm inflammation in the skin as well as slow down visible signs of aging caused by the sun. “Vitamin E is also great at nourishing and moisturizing the skin topically,” he says. “It's even more beneficial for those who suffer with chronically dry skin or eczema as it has long-lasting moisturizing and soothing benefits.”"}},"e6353d43-f7dd-47d5-a5e5-b8f6a7976f9c":{"type":"1-col-quote-center","settings":{"quote-center-article":"education\/vitamin-e-in-skincare","quotes":"“When used topically, vitamin E can help protect the skin from this free radical-induced damage, so it may be able to help keep skin more supple and protect from hyperpigmentation.”","author_quotes":""}},"7cbc59bd-f532-400e-b0d2-de12ff63e00b":{"type":"1-col-text-wh-center","settings":{"text-wh-center-article":"education\/vitamin-e-in-skincare","heading":"When is the best time to use vitamin E?","description":"There’s a lot to consider when selecting the right vitamin E formulation for your own needs, but Garrette says something to consider first is whether to use pure vitamin E vs. seeking it out within a larger formulation. “Vitamin E can be used in its pure oil form, but it's usually included in most moisturizers, serums, and other skincare products,” he notes. “It can be used anytime of the day, all over the body, in your morning and night time skincare routines.” Scott says it’s also great to use under sunscreen daily, “...to get more protection from the day-to-day environmental stressors.” \n<br>\n<br>\nThis isn’t to say vitamin E is suitable for everyone, though.

With a tailored brow routine and nighttime treatments, you will certainly see a difference over time,” she adds."}},"12155439-11d3-4b6f-b439-2f2c31a802f2":{"type":"1-col-text-center","settings":{"text-center-article":"profile\/top-international-florists-beauty-self-care-interview","text_center":"Botanicals have always been part of the essence of Rose Inc.

A decade ago, a mention of the term was more likely to engender confused stares (and maybe some eye rolls) than genuine interest. But these days, you can’t even scroll TikTok or Instagram for more than a minute or two before stumbling upon a creator sharing an affirmation or endorsement of the practice. If you ask London-based personal development coach and manifesting expert <b><a href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/roxienafousi\/\/\"> Roxie Nafousi<\/a> <\/b>, it can actually change your life. By her own account, she’s living proof. “I mean this in as humble a way as possible, but the success that I've had is a short space of time and the transformation in my life does feel like a miracle in many ways,” she said in a recent interview with Rose Inc. “I know it's all manifesting in action. I'm here to show everyone that a transformation is possible for us all and you really can make your dreams come true.” \n<br>\n<br>\nBut Nafousi’s journey hasn’t always been easy. From the start of her career as a beauty and lifestyle influencer, she’s been open with her tens of thousands of Instagram followers about her battles with depression and other mental health struggles.

She writes about this and more in her forthcoming book, <i>Manifest: 7 Steps to Living Your Best Life<\/i>, which comes out in January of next year.

I was in the grips of addiction to drugs and alcohol, I was smoking 20 cigarettes a day and I had crippling low self-worth. I was just trying to constantly escape through all these hedonistic ways. But throughout this time, I would go on health retreats and I would feel really good and this fog of sadness would lift. So I kind of knew there was something there and that my lifestyle and my depression were infecting each other. It seems obvious from the outside, but when you're in it, it's actually hard to decipher. So I did have this kind of affinity for wellness, but I just couldn't seem to sustain it. After many, many rock bottoms, I thought, OK, I'll leave London and do my yoga teacher training. I'd found that throughout this time, yoga had really provided me a very safe space. I would cry on the mat a lot. My sanctuary was yoga. I knew no matter what I wanted to help people—that was non-negotiable. That was always in me. \n<br>\n<br>\nNot thinking it was ever going to be a career, I just would start writing. I was writing for <i>Marie Claire<\/i> at the time and I wrote this open letter about my depression and I started talking more about mental health as I was going through it. I wasn't talking about it from a place of, \"Oh, I've healed.\" It was like, I'm just really in this mess, but I'm trying to find my way out. Then I went and did my yoga teacher training and after a month of being away thinking I'm going to do yoga for a living, I  heard about something called manifestation. And something clicked in me. It clicked to me that we all had the power to create the life that we want and I really knew that I had been manifesting in the wrong way. So my low self-worth, my depression, my addiction had also been allowing me to keep myself stuck in a really negative space. I was allowing myself to be a victim. So the first step of manifesting was really understanding that I had the power to make a change and all of it lied within me. It was there. So then, Wade, who is my current partner, messaged me on Raya literally one week later. We met and to put it simply, a year to the day that he messaged me, our baby boy Wolf was born.<\/p>","dropcap_3":"","dropcap_description_3":"","dropcap_4":"","dropcap_description_4":"","dropcap_5":"","dropcap_description_5":"","dropcap_6":"","dropcap_description_6":"","dropcap_7":"","dropcap_description_7":"","dropcap_8":"","dropcap_description_8":"","dropcap_9":"","dropcap_description_9":"","dropcap_10":"","dropcap_description_10":""}},"cd4f584c-8d38-48c5-a97a-879aaf5a2de9":{"type":"2-col-image-text","settings":{"image-text-article":"profile\/roxie-nafousi-manifesting-mental-health-beauty-interview","dropcap_1":"RI:","dropcap_description_1":"Did your pregnancy play out how you imagined it would?","dropcap_2":"RN:","dropcap_description_2":"The reason I found out I was pregnant was actually because I was feeling really low and I thought, well, I'm in a new relationship, this is when I'm supposed to be on that high vibe and in the honeymoon phase. And then my sister suggested I take a test, and I was pregnant. But when the depression wasn't lifting and it was getting worse—I was becoming very hopeless—that's when my midwife told me that this is clearly prenatal depression. With the NHS here, the wait for getting on the list to see a counselor was impossible. I had a really great support system, so I was OK, but it is worrying for a lot of expecting mothers who are suffering from prenatal depression when there isn't that much support or awareness. I was so grateful to be pregnant, but the mental prison that you're in [when you suffer from depression] is not something you can control. \n<br>\n<br>\nA week before I had found out I was pregnant, I'd started something called Agony Aunt Sundays, where every Sunday on Instagram I would give people advice. At the top of this pregnancy, I didn't work and I was earning absolutely no money. I was just binge eating all the time because that was my way of coping. I gained six stone. But every Sunday, I could help people. And this was the one thread that really held me together. Then while I was pregnant, every day I would visualize myself coming out of pregnancy and being the best version of myself and that hope really kept me going. I held onto those visions and something just happened when Wolf was born. I just went, this is it, I'm going to do it, I'm going make all these dreams come true. And within four months, I had decided to host my first workshop, and it was going to be the self-love workshop. I always knew it would be because self-love is at the core of everything. And it sold out straight away, which shocked me, and it was only because of these Agony Aunt Sundays. It was because I'd taken people on this journey with me and I shared everything. And then the next workshop I did was manifesting.","dropcap_3":"","dropcap_description_3":"","dropcap_4":"","dropcap_description_4":"","dropcap_5":"","dropcap_description_5":"","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Editorial-The-Profile-Roxie-Nafousi-3.jpg","link":""}},"c4820e73-78cd-40f8-a1aa-2cd37117439d":{"type":"1-col-quote-center","settings":{"quote-center-article":"profile\/roxie-nafousi-manifesting-mental-health-beauty-interview","quotes":"\"I'm here to show everyone that a transformation is possible for us all and you really can make your dreams come true.\"","author_quotes":""}},"cf67f933-194e-4d3e-98dd-1de0f9277e92":{"type":"2col-text-image","settings":{"article":"profile\/roxie-nafousi-manifesting-mental-health-beauty-interview","left_dropcap_1":"RI:","left_dropcap_description_1":"Did you establish any rituals or self-care practices during that time that helped you?","left_dropcap_2":"RN:","left_dropcap_description_2":"Massage was incredible for me.

One time they had blue eyeshadow and Britney Spears was my idol at the time, and she wore blue eyeshadow. I was so excited and that was my first kind of try at makeup or anything beauty-related. I just remember sitting in my mirror, fingers covered with this blue eyeshadow free from my magazine. We've come a long way since then, but it was a fantastic moment.\n<br>\n<br>\nSince then, I’ve loved makeup. I must have been 12 or 13 and, I mean the makeup trends were not good, but we were trying to contour in our own way. Even before contouring was a thing, I used to always put concealer down the center of my nose and lighten up under my eyes. By the time I was 19 I had that Tom Ford Illuminating Powder Duo, which I would use to contour. I was always trying to experiment with sculpting my face, but I was terrible with skincare. So I was a bar of soap kind of girl and that was how I was taking off my makeup—I was scrubbing soap into my mascara to get it all off. It was only when I was about 21 I went for a very fancy at Claridge’s and they used Sisley products on me and recommended me to get this Sisley skincare and it completely transformed my breakouts, which I had really badly at the time.

I would start by saying less is more and simplifying things has been amazing for me. I start with a cleanser. At the moment I use Murad AHA Exfoliating Cleanser and I've found that AHA is really good for keeping my breakouts at bay. Then I use a hyaluronic acid serum. I use Organic Pharmacy, but when I started using hyaluronic acid my skin changed. The glow was real and I had found that things like vitamin C and retinol didn't really agree with me. Since I had Wolf, my skin is much more sensitive. So I have my serum and then I use Clinique Moisture Surge religiously. I've been using it for 10 years. I have tried so many moisturizers and every time, I go back to it and I have been through about 25 or 30 pots, easy. It just really works for me. I found out only recently, I don't know why I never even looked at the ingredients, but it does have hyaluronic acid in it. So maybe that's why my skin likes it. And then I use the Malin+Goetz Acne Nighttime Treatment for breakouts. So that's my basic skincare routine. It's so simple. I also love a good sheet mask and using any cooling de-puffers. I put on the sheet mask and rub my cooling cryo things over it and it's heaven.

In general, <b><a a=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/joshzeichnermd\/\">Joshua Zeichner<\/a><\/b>, MD, a dermatologist, associate professor of dermatology, and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital, says, “inflammation means that there is disruption of the normal skin structure along with dilated blood vessels and an influx of blood cells.”\n<br>\n<br>\nSo what causes skin inflammation? According to Marino, various internal and external factors can be the culprit. “Triggering stimuli include UV radiation, heat, allergens, irritants like fragrances\/soaps, smoking, pollution, diet, dryness, impaired skin barrier, and more,” she says. “Hormones are also linked to inflammatory skin disorders like melasma and acne.”","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/download_f3392d68-005c-4f76-807f-7753a9d11958.jpg","link":"","image_title":""}},"7132bc28-3f10-48ae-8207-3f145bc24ca9":{"type":"1-col-text-wh-center","settings":{"text-wh-center-article":"education\/what-causes-skin-inflammation","heading":"HOW SKIN INFLAMMATION CAN MANIFEST","description":"Marino says skin inflammation can manifest in many different ways ranging from acute inflammation such as redness to chronic inflammatory conditions. Here are some of the most common forms of skin inflammation and their causes.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Acne:<\/b> Acne is a form of skin inflammation that manifests as red bumps, pus pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads. “It starts when dead cell debris and oil get trapped in a pore and form a plug, blocking the opening of the pore,” Marino says. “Oil production continues, causing the area to become inflamed and attracts bacteria.”<br>\n<br>\n<b>Eczema:<\/b> With eczema, Dr. Zeichner says the skin barrier isn’t working as well as it should be, which leads to microscopic cracks in the skin and loss of hydration. This results in dry, itchy, flaky patches of skin.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Melasma:<\/b> This type of skin inflammation is caused by “an overproduction of melanin triggered by inflammatory triggers from heat, hormones or sun,” Marino says. “It appears as large, brown, discolored patches on the skin, typically on the forehead, cheeks, and upper lip.”\nPsoriasis: Psoriasis can show up as red, thick patches with white scales, Dr. Zeichner says. He explains that with this condition, the skin is inflamed because the immune system gets angry at the skin itself leading to a buildup of dead cells on the skin’s surface.\nRosacea: Dr. Zeichner says people with this inflammatory condition will typically have redness, burning, and stinging in the middle third of the face. “It is caused by overactivity of the immune system in your skin, causing the skin to overreact to environmental triggers like spicy foods, hot beverages, or even alcohol,” he says."}},"d167a7c4-6376-430f-8f75-339d95803601":{"type":"1-col-quote-center","settings":{"quote-center-article":"education\/what-causes-skin-inflammation","quotes":"\"...INFLAMMATION MEANS THAT THERE IS DISRUPTION OF THE NORMAL SKIN STRUCTURE ALONG WITH DILATED BLOOD VESSELS AND AN INFLUX OF BLOOD CELLS.\"","author_quotes":""}},"134470f0-f091-49aa-8ad6-8a66f864c13d":{"type":"2-col-image-text-wh","settings":{"image-text-wh-article":"education\/what-causes-skin-inflammation","image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/download_1.jpg","link":"","image_title":"","heading":"HOW TO COMBAT SKIN INFLAMMATION","description":"<b>A Healthy Lifestyle:<\/b>“Inflammation is almost always lifestyle-related,” Marino says. She recommends practicing healthy rituals such as drinking enough water, getting rest, exercising, avoiding alcohol and smoking, and consuming anti-inflammatory foods like green tea, salmon, broccoli, and avocado, which can all go a long way in helping combat inflammation in the face and body.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Ice Therapy:<\/b> Using ice therapy products, such as ice rollers, is a popular way to help reduce inflammation. “Ice and cool temperatures help constrict blood vessels to remove excess fluid and decrease inflammation,” Dr. Zeichner says. Marino recommends practicing ice therapy first thing in the morning for five to 10 minutes on clean skin.\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Skincare:<\/b> Combating skin inflammation also requires an appropriate, consistent skincare routine. Dr. Zeichner recommends incorporating products with skin-protecting ingredients such as purified petrolatum, ceramides, or oat extract. He also suggests anti-inflammatory ingredients such as niacinamide or botanical extracts like feverfew and licorice root extract.\n<br>\n<br>\n<i> Stay tuned for Rose Inc’s guide for treating skin

IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.<br\/>1.\tInitial Dispute Resolution. We are available by email at customercare@roseinc.co.uk  to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Store or any feature made available to you, including any rewards program. Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. You agree to use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.<br\/>2.\tAgreement to Binding Arbitration. If we do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to Section 16(a) above, then either you or we may initiate binding arbitration. Except for any disputes excluded below in Section 16(d), all claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and\/or your use of the Store, products or services shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered on a confidential basis by either the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") (adr.org, 1.800.778.7879), or in accordance with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services (“JAMS”) (jamsadr.com, 1.800.352.5267) Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. You can contact AAA or JAMS to find out more information on how to commence an arbitration proceeding. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's or JAMS' applicable rules.<br\/>3.\tEach party will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense. The parties shall select a single neutral arbitrator in accordance with the applicable rules and procedures of the applicable arbitration entity (AAA or JAMS). The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. If you initiate arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty U.S. Dollars ($250) and the claim is found to be non-frivolous, we will pay the additional cost. If we are required to pay the additional cost of the filing fees, you should submit a request for payment of fees to AAA or JAMS (as applicable) along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to AAA or JAMS (as applicable). We will also be responsible for paying all other arbitration costs arising in connection with the arbitration, other than costs incurred by you for legal counsel, travel and other out-of-pocket costs and expenses not constituting fees or amounts payable to AAA or JAMS (as applicable). You will not be required to pay fees and costs incurred by us if you do not prevail in arbitration. We will also pay AAA or JAMS (as applicable) to reimburse you for any portion of the $250 filing fee that is more than what you would otherwise have to pay to file suit in a court of law with jurisdiction over the subject matter located in San Francisco, CA.<br\/>4.\tYou understand that, absent this mandatory provision, you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. You further understand that the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.<br\/>5.\tClass Action and Class Arbitration Waiver. You and we each further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in our respective individual capacities only and not as a class action, and you and we each expressly waive our respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in Section 16(b) shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.<br\/>6.\tExceptions. Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief (i) in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction, and (ii) any disputes relating to intellectual property rights, obligations, or any infringement claims.<br\/>7.\t30 Day Right to Opt-Out. You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Sections 16(b) and 16(c) by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out by emailing us at arbitrationoptout@amyris.com. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of the date you first accept the Terms by using the Store, or the effective date of the first set of Terms containing an Arbitration and Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver section otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.<br\/>8.\tTerm for Cause of Action. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of the Store or any services or the Terms must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred.<br\/>9.\tExclusive Venue for Litigation. To the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth in Section 16(b) do not apply or if you have opted out of arbitration, you agree that any litigation shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside). You and we expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction in San Francisco County, California for any litigation other than small claims court actions. In the event of litigation relating to these Terms, you agree to waive, to the maximum extent permitted by law, any right to a jury trial, except where a jury trial waiver is not permissible under applicable law.<\/p>"}},"17a6e2fe-1199-4400-bd3e-8f015c5cf3c7":{"type":"paragraph_title_bold","settings":{"par_title_bold":"18.

These include laws and regulations regarding forced labor, underage labor, modern slavery, human trafficking, minimum wage and working hours. Amyris engages with contract manufacturers and other suppliers through a vendor guide and a standard manufacturing agreement that incorporate our Supplier Code of Conduct. The vendor guide also provides Amyris’ Environmental and Sustainability Policy. <\/p><p>New contract manufacturers are required to complete a qualification form, including a self\u0002assessment on social responsibility. The form includes questions on the contract manufacturer’s efforts to promote social responsibility among employees, efforts to ensure the work environment is diverse, equitable and inclusive, as well as safe and healthy, to ensure compliance with local laws and regulations and prohibition of forced or child labor, and to institute anticorruption policies, among other criteria. The responses are reviewed by Amyris’ supply chain team to ensure compliance with our standards. In 2021, two companies were audited following their responses to the qualification form. Suppliers are also strongly encouraged to comply with the SA8000 international labor standards. <\/p><p>As for the risk assessment, we identify the human rights risk associated with each geography by using the World Bank’s World Governance Indicators, U.S. State Department Trafficking in Persons Report, U.S. Department of Labour’s List of Goods Produced by Child Labour or Forced Labour and other resources. On the basis of these indicators we consider Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa, South, Southeast and North Asia, and Central and South America geographies with elevated human rights risks. Providers from these regions are carefully scrutinized by the Amyris supply chain team to ensure compliance with our ethical standards. <\/p><p>Amyris recognizes the importance of transparency in our supply chain to ensure human rights for all workers that contribute to our products. Despite not being subject to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, we endeavor to conduct our business activities in accordance with the Act, and we report on preventing slavery and human trafficking in our supply chain. If applicable, our suppliers must comply with the same Act and ensure that the products they make for Amyris, including any materials sourced in connection with production of the product, are not manufactured, assembled or packaged by forced, prison or child labor. <\/p><p>As part of our compliance process, we conduct supplier diligence and third-party verification of all our suppliers. In addition, under our Supplier Code of Conduct, we reserve the right to provide periodic assessments and engage in audits of our suppliers. Amyris will consider measures such as auditing, directly or by a third party, of any suppliers we determine to present a legitimate risk of not respecting our Supplier Code of Conduct. If a non-compliance issue is not resolved in a timely manner, then Amyris will re-evaluate its business relationship with the supplier, including potential termination of the business relationship. Amyris’ supply chain registered no reported violations of the Supplier Code of Conduct, according to supplier diligence and verification processes conducted in 2021. <\/p><p>Several Amyris products utilize sugarcane sourced from Brazil. In 2021, for the second year in a row, Amyris received Bonsucro Chain of Custody Certification ensuring that sustainability claims along our sugarcane supply chain are traceable from farmer to end user. Companies certified by Bonsucro commit to a code of conduct supporting fair-trade and labor practices, including working with ethical supply chains. The code is aligned with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights and multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals, including Responsible Consumption and Production (Goal 12) and Climate Action (Goal 13). This code also supports the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises and draws on the OECD-Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Guidance for Responsible Agricultural Supply Chains. <\/p><p>In 2021, the U.S. Government enacted the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) detailing the prohibition of imports from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China and the United Kingdom’s Foreign Secretary announced a package of measures to help ensure that British organisations, whether public or private sector, are not complicit in, nor profiting from, the human rights violations in Xinjiang so to ensure that they are not contributing to the abuse of the Uyghur Muslims or other minorities in Xinjiang. While Amyris does not source products from the affected region, we support the Act and conduct due diligence around the subject. For example, as part of the launch of a new product manufactured in China, Amyris’ Director of Production initiated an inquiry into the source of the ingredients to ensure that no forced labor was part of the supply chain, to ensure compliance with the UFLPA. As a result, the supplier confirmed that the item was sourced from a different region. Amyris continues to monitor the sourcing to ensure no part of the supply chain is located in the Xinjiang region.<\/p>"}},"0a5e3e5b-3a31-42d5-bac5-023c6e556adb":{"type":"paragraph_title_med","settings":{"par_title_med":"Training"}},"0bb22ec9-3f20-4bd1-b9a9-29e1f9955866":{"type":"paragraph_text","settings":{"par_text":"<p>All Amyris employees, including executive leaders, are required to undergo training on the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics—which explains Amyris’ commitment to equal employment opportunities—both as new hires and every two years thereafter.
